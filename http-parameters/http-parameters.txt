   respond-async                            Indicates that the client prefers that the server respond   [RFC7240], Section 4.1
                                            asynchronously to a request.
                                            When the value is "minimal", it indicates that the client
                                            prefers that the server return a minimal response to a
   return        One of either "minimal" or request. When the value is "representation", it indicates   [RFC7240], Section 4.2
                 "representation"           that the client prefers that the server include a
                                            representation of the current state of the resource in
                                            response to a request.

   wait                                     expects it will take the server to process the request once [RFC7240], Section 4.3
                                            it has been received.
                                            When value is "strict", it indicates that the client wishes
                                            the server to apply strict validation and error handling to
   handling      One of either "strict" or  the processing of a request. When the value is "lenient",   [RFC7240], Section 4.4
                 "lenient"                  it indicates that the client wishes the server to apply

                                            The "depth-noroot" preference indicates that the client
                                            wishes for the server to exclude the target (root) resource
   depth-noroot                             from processing by the WebDAV method and only apply the     [RFC-murchison-webdav-prefer-14], Section 4
