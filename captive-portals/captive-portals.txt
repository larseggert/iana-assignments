                                     Indicates whether the client is in a state of captivity, i.e
                                     it has not satisfied the conditions to access the external
   captive                   boolean network. If the client is captive (i.e. captive=true), it will [RFC8908]
                                     still be allowed enough access for it to perform server
                                     authentication [RFC8908, Section 4.1].
   user-portal-url           string  Provides the URL of a web portal that MUST be accessed over    [RFC8908]
                                     TLS with which a user can interact.
                                     Provides the URL of a webpage or site that SHOULD be accessed
   venue-info-url            string  over TLS on which the operator of the network has information  [RFC8908]
                                     that it wishes to share with the user (e.g., store info, maps,
                                     flight status, or entertainment).
                                     Indicates that the URL specified as "user-portal-url" allows
                                     the user to extend a session once the client is no longer in a
   can-extend-session        boolean state of captivity. This provides a hint that a client system  [RFC8908]
                                     can suggest accessing the portal URL to the user when the
                                     session is near its limit in terms of time or bytes.

                                     captive (i.e. captive=false) and the client session is
                                     time-limited, and SHOULD omit this value for captive clients
                                     (i.e. captive=true) or when the session is not time-limited.
                                     An integer that indicates the number of bytes remaining, after
                                     which the client will be in placed into a captive state. The
                                     byte count represents the sum of the total number of IP packet
                                     (layer 3) bytes sent and received by the client, including IP
                                     headers. Captive portal systems might not count traffic to

                                     cannot rely on such behavior. The API server SHOULD include
                                     this value if the client is not captive (i.e. captive=false)
                                     and the client session is byte-limited, and SHOULD omit this
                                     value for captive clients (i.e. captive=true) or when the
                                     session is not byte-limited.
                                     Provides the URL of the authentication server that MUST be
                                     accessed over TLS with which the client is authenticated
                                     without user interaction. Authentication Server authenticates
   client-authentication-url string  clients using the HTTP authentication framework specified in   [draft-sawant-capport-api-state-enhancement-02]
                                     [RFC9110]. The server MUST NOT require user interaction on the
                                     client device. The client MUST have a credential to perform
                                     the authentication without user interaction.
