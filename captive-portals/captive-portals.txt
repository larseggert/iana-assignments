          Key          Type                                                   Description                                                 Reference
                              Indicates whether the client is in a state of captivity, i.e it has not satisfied the conditions to access
   captive            boolean the external network. If the client is captive (i.e. captive=true), it will still be allowed enough access  [RFC8908]
                              for it to perform server authentication [RFC8908, Section 4.1].
   user-portal-url    string  Provides the URL of a web portal that MUST be accessed over TLS with which a user can interact.             [RFC8908]
                              Provides the URL of a webpage or site that SHOULD be accessed over TLS on which the operator of the network
   venue-info-url     string  has information that it wishes to share with the user (e.g., store info, maps, flight status, or            [RFC8908]
                              entertainment).
                              Indicates that the URL specified as "user-portal-url" allows the user to extend a session once the client
   can-extend-session boolean is no longer in a state of captivity. This provides a hint that a client system can suggest accessing the   [RFC8908]
                              portal URL to the user when the session is near its limit in terms of time or bytes.
                              An integer that indicates the number of seconds remaining, after which the client will be placed into a
   seconds-remaining  number  captive state. The API server SHOULD include this value if the client is not captive (i.e. captive=false)   [RFC8908]
                              and the client session is time-limited, and SHOULD omit this value for captive clients (i.e. captive=true)
                              or when the session is not time-limited.
                              An integer that indicates the number of bytes remaining, after which the client will be in placed into a
                              captive state. The byte count represents the sum of the total number of IP packet (layer 3) bytes sent and
   bytes-remaining    number  received by the client, including IP headers. Captive portal systems might not count traffic to whitelisted [RFC8908]
                              servers, such as the API server, but clients cannot rely on such behavior. The API server SHOULD include
                              this value if the client is not captive (i.e. captive=false) and the client session is byte-limited, and
                              SHOULD omit this value for captive clients (i.e. captive=true) or when the session is not byte-limited.
