 The following standards-related organizations have registered Media
 Types in the Standards Tree on or after 21 June 2012. IANA will
 process future requests from these organizations without further
 consultation with the IESG. Requests from other organizations will be
 confirmed by the IESG, and after such confirmation those organizations
 will be added to this list. In any case, all Media Type registrations
 in the Standards Tree go through normal Expert Review.
