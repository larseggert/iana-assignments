                                                   Differentiated Services Field Codepoints (DSCP)

   Last Updated

   Note

 The Differentiated Services (Diffserv) architecture specifies use
 of the DS field in the IPv4 and IPv6 packet headers to carry one
 of 64 distict differentiated services field codepoint (DSCP) values.
 The codepoint space is divided into three pools for the purpose of
 codepoint assignment and management: a pool of 32 codepoints (Pool 1)
 to be assigned by Standards Action as defined in [RFC8126], a pool of
 16 codepoints (Pool 2) to be reserved for experimental or Local Use
 (EXP/LU) as defined in [RFC8126], and a pool of 16 codepoints (Pool 3)
 which are initially available for experimental or local use, but
 which should be preferentially utilized for standardized assignments
 if Pool 1 is ever exhausted. Pool 3 codepoints are now utilized for
 standardized assignments and are no longer available for experimental
 or local use, as specified by [RFC8436]. The pools are defined in the
 following table (where 'x' refers to either '0' or '1').
