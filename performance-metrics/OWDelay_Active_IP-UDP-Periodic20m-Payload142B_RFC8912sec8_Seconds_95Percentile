8.2. Metric Definition

   This category includes columns to prompt the entry of all necessary details related to the metric definition, including 
   the RFC reference and values of input factors, called "Fixed Parameters".

8.2.1. Reference Definition

   For delay:

   Almes, G., Kalidindi, S., Zekauskas, M., and A. Morton, Ed., "A One-Way Delay Metric for IP Performance Metrics 
   (IPPM)", STD 81, RFC 7679, DOI 10.17487/RFC7679, January 2016, <https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc7679>. [RFC7679]

   Morton, A. and E. Stephan, "Spatial Composition of Metrics", RFC 6049, DOI 10.17487/RFC6049, January 2011, 
   <https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc6049>. [RFC6049]

   Section 3.4 of [RFC7679] provides the reference definition of the singleton (single value) one-way delay metric. 
   Section 4.4 of [RFC7679] provides the reference definition expanded to cover a multi-value sample. Note that terms 
   such as "singleton" and "sample" are defined in Section 11 of [RFC2330].

   Only successful packet transfers with finite delay are included in the sample, as prescribed in Section 4.1.2 
   of [RFC6049].

   decimal64 with fraction digits = 4 (see Section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) and with a resolution of 0.0001 seconds (0.1 ms), 
   with lossless conversion to/from the 32-bit NTP timestamp as per Section 6 of [RFC5905].

   See the Packet Stream Generation section for three additional Fixed Parameters.

8.3. Method of Measurement

   This category includes columns for references to relevant sections of the RFC(s) and any supplemental information 
   needed to ensure an unambiguous method for implementations.

8.3.1. Reference Methods

   The methodology for this metric (equivalent to Type-P-One-way-Delay-Poisson-Stream) is defined as in Section 3.6 of
   [RFC7679] (for singletons) and Section 4.6 of [RFC7679] (for samples) using the Type-P and Tmax defined in the Fixed 
   Parameters column. However, a Periodic stream is used, as defined in [RFC3432].

   The reference method distinguishes between long-delayed packets and lost packets by implementing a maximum waiting 
   time for packet arrival. Tmax is the waiting time used as the threshold to declare a packet lost. Lost packets SHALL 
   be designated as having undefined delay and counted for the OWLoss metric.

   The calculations on the one-way delay SHALL be performed on the conditional distribution, conditioned on successful 
   packet arrival within Tmax. Also, when all packet delays are stored, the process that calculates the one-way delay 
   value MUST enforce the Tmax threshold on stored values before calculations. See Section 4.1 of [RFC3393] for details 
   on the conditional distribution to exclude undefined values of delay, and see Section 5 of [RFC6703] for background 
   on this analysis choice.

   The reference method requires some way to distinguish between different packets in a stream to establish 
   correspondence between sending times and receiving times for each successfully arriving packet.

   Since a standard measurement protocol is employed [RFC5357], the measurement process will determine the sequence 
   numbers or timestamps applied to test packets after the Fixed and Runtime Parameters are passed to that process. 
   The measurement protocol dictates the format of sequence numbers and timestamps conveyed in the TWAMP-Test packet 
   payload.

8.3.2. Packet Stream Generation

   This section provides details regarding packet traffic, which is used as the basis for measurement. In IPPM Metrics, 
   this is called the "stream"; this stream can easily be described by providing the list of stream Parameters.

   Section 3 of [RFC3432] prescribes the method for generating Periodic streams using associated Parameters.

   incT:  The nominal duration of the inter-packet interval, first bit to first bit, with value 0.0200, expressed in 
   units of seconds, as a positive value of type decimal64 with fraction digits = 4 (see Section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) and 
   with a resolution of 0.0001 seconds (0.1 ms), with lossless conversion to/from the 32-bit NTP timestamp as per 
   Section 6 of [RFC5905].

   dT:  The duration of the interval for allowed sample start times, with value 1.0000, expressed in units of seconds, 
   as a positive value of type decimal64 with fraction digits = 4 (see Section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) and with a resolution 
   of 0.0001 seconds (0.1 ms), with lossless conversion to/from the 32-bit NTP timestamp as per Section 6 of [RFC5905].

   T0:  The actual start time of the periodic stream, determined from T0 and dT.

   Note: An initiation process with a number of control exchanges resulting in unpredictable start times (within a time
   interval) may be sufficient to avoid synchronization of periodic streams and is a valid replacement for selecting a 
   start time at random from a fixed interval.

   These stream Parameters will be specified as Runtime Parameters.

8.3.5. Runtime Parameters and Data Format

   Runtime Parameters are input factors that must be determined, configured into the measurement system, and reported with 
   the results for the context to be complete.

   Src:  The IP address of the host in the Src Role (format ipv4‑address-no-zone value for IPv4 or 
   ipv6-address-no-zone value for IPv6; see Section 4 of [RFC6991]).

   Dst:  The IP address of the host in the Dst Role (format ipv4‑address-no-zone value for IPv4 or 
   ipv6-address-no-zone value for IPv6; see Section 4 of [RFC6991]).

   T0:  A time, the start of a measurement interval (format "date‑time" as specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339]; 
   see also "date‑and‑time" in Section 3 of [RFC6991]). The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of [RFC2330]. When T0 
   is "all-zeros", a start time is unspecified and Tf is to be interpreted as the duration of the measurement interval. 
   The start time is controlled through other means.

   Tf:  A time, the end of a measurement interval (format "date‑time" as specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339]; see also
   "date‑and‑time" in Section 3 of [RFC6991]). The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of [RFC2330]. When T0 is 
   "all-zeros", an ending time and date is ignored and Tf is interpreted as the duration of the measurement interval.

8.3.6. Roles

   Src:  Launches each packet and waits for return transmissions from the Dst.  An example is the TWAMP 
   Session-Sender.

   Dst:  Waits for each packet from the Src and sends a return packet to the Src.  An example is the TWAMP 
   Session-Reflector.

8.4. Output

   This category specifies all details of the output of measurements using the metric.

8.4.1. Type

   Latency Types are discussed in the subsections below.

8.4.2. Reference Definition

   For all output types:

   T0:  The start of a measurement interval (format "date‑time" as specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339]; see also
   "date‑and‑time" in Section 3 of [RFC6991]). The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of [RFC2330].

   Tf:  The end of a measurement interval (format "date‑time" as specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339]; see also
   "date‑and‑time" in Section 3 of [RFC6991]). The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of [RFC2330].

   The 95th percentile SHALL be calculated using the conditional distribution of all packets with a finite value of 
   one-way delay (undefined delays are excluded) -- a single value, as follows:

   See Section 4.1 of [RFC3393] for details on the conditional distribution to exclude undefined values of delay, and 
   see Section 5 of [RFC6703] for background on this analysis choice.

   See Section 4.3 of [RFC3393] for details on the percentile statistic (where round-trip delay should be substituted 
   for "ipdv").

   The percentile = 95, meaning that the reported delay, "95Percentile", is the smallest value of one-way delay for 
   which the Empirical Distribution Function, EDF(95Percentile), is greater than or equal to 95% of the singleton 
   one-way delay values in the conditional distribution. See Section 11.3 of [RFC2330] for the definition of the 
   percentile statistic using the EDF.

   95Percentile:
   The time value of the result is expressed in units of seconds, as a positive value of type decimal64 with fraction 
   digits = 9 (see Section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) with a resolution of 0.000000001 seconds (1.0 ns), and with lossless 
   conversion to/from the 64-bit NTP timestamp as per Section 6 of [RFC5905].

8.4.3. Metric Units

   The 95th percentile of one-way delay is expressed in seconds.

8.4.4. Calibration

   Section 3.7.3 of [RFC7679] provides a means to quantify the systematic and random errors of a time measurement. 
   Calibration in-situ could be enabled with an internal loopback that includes as much of the measurement system as 
   possible, performs address manipulation as needed, and provides some form of isolation (e.g., deterministic delay) 
   to avoid send-receive interface contention. Some portion of the random and systematic error can be characterized in 
   this way.

   For one-way delay measurements, the error calibration must include an assessment of the internal clock synchronization 
   with its external reference (this internal clock is supplying timestamps for measurement). In practice, the time offsets
   [RFC5905] of clocks at both the Source and Destination are needed to estimate the systematic error due to imperfect 
   clock synchronization (the time offsets [RFC5905] are smoothed; thus, the random variation is not usually represented 
   in the results).

   time_offset:  The time value of the result is expressed in units of seconds, as a signed value of type decimal64 with
   fraction digits = 9 (see Section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) with a resolution of 0.000000001 seconds (1.0 ns), and with lossless
   conversion to/from the 64-bit NTP timestamp as per Section 6 of [RFC5905].

   When a measurement controller requests a calibration measurement, the loopback is applied and the result is output 
   in the same format as a normal measurement, with an additional indication that it is a calibration result. In any 
   measurement, the measurement function SHOULD report its current estimate of the time offset [RFC5905] as an indicator 
   of the degree of synchronization.

   Both internal loopback calibration and clock synchronization can be used to estimate the available accuracy of the 
   Output Metric Units. For example, repeated loopback delay measurements will reveal the portion of the output result
   resolution that is the result of system noise and is thus inaccurate.
