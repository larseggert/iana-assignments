   RTLoss:
      This metric assesses the loss ratio of a stream of packets exchanged between 
      two hosts (which are the two measurement points). The output is the round-trip 
      loss ratio for all transmitted packets expressed as a percentage.

4.2. Metric Definition

   This category includes columns to prompt the entry of all necessary details related to the metric 
   definition, including the RFC reference and values of input factors, called "Fixed Parameters".

4.2.1. Reference Definition

   Morton, A., "Round-Trip Packet Loss Metrics", RFC 6673, DOI 10.17487/RFC6673, 
   August 2012, <https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc6673>. [RFC6673]

   Both Delay and Loss metrics employ a maximum waiting time for received packets, so 
   the count of lost packets to total packets sent is the basis for the loss ratio calculation 
   as per Section 6.1 of [RFC6673].

4.2.2. Fixed Parameters

   IPv4 header values:
      DSCP:  Set to 0
      TTL:   Set to 255
      Protocol:  Set to 17 (UDP)

   IPv6 header values:
      DSCP:  Set to 0
      Hop Count:  Set to 255
      Next Header:  Set to 17 (UDP)
      Flow Label:  Set to 0
      Extension Headers:  None

   UDP header values:

      Checksum:  The checksum MUST be calculated and the non-zero checksum included in the header
      
   UDP Payload:  

      Total of 100 bytes

   Other measurement Parameters:

   Tmax:
      A loss threshold waiting time with value 3.0, expressed in units of seconds, as a positive 
      value of type decimal64 with fraction digits = 4 (see Section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) and with a 
      resolution of 0.0001 seconds (0.1 ms), with lossless conversion to/from the 32-bit NTP 
      timestamp as per Section 6 of [RFC5905].

4.3. Method of Measurement

   This category includes columns for references to relevant sections of the RFC(s) and 
   any supplemental information needed to ensure an unambiguous method for implementations.

4.3.1. Reference Methods

   The methodology for this metric (equivalent to Type-P-Round-trip- Delay and 
   Type-P-Round-trip-Delay-Poisson-Stream) is defined as in Section 2.6 of [RFC2681] 
   (for singletons) and Section 3.6 of [RFC2681] (for samples) using the Type-P and 
   Tmax defined in the Fixed Parameters column. However, the Periodic stream will be 
   generated according to [RFC3432].

   The reference method distinguishes between long-delayed packets and lost packets by 
   implementing a maximum waiting time for packet arrival. Tmax is the waiting time used 
   as the threshold to declare a packet lost. Lost packets SHALL be designated as having 
   undefined delay and counted for the RTLoss metric [RFC6673].

   The calculations on the delay (RTT) SHALL be performed on the conditional distribution, 
   conditioned on successful packet arrival within Tmax. Also, when all packet delays are 
   stored, the process that calculates the RTT value MUST enforce the Tmax threshold on 
   stored values before calculations. See Section 4.1 of [RFC3393] for details on the 
   conditional distribution to exclude undefined values of delay, and see Section 5 of 
   [RFC6703] for background on this analysis choice.

   The reference method requires some way to distinguish between different packets in a 
   stream to establish correspondence between sending times and receiving times for each 
   successfully arriving packet. Sequence numbers or other send-order identification MUST 
   be retained at the Src or included with each packet to disambiguate packet reordering 
   if it occurs.

   If a standard measurement protocol is employed, then the measurement process will determine 
   the sequence numbers or timestamps applied to test packets after the Fixed and Runtime 
   Parameters are passed to that process. The chosen measurement protocol will dictate the 
   format of sequence numbers and timestamps, if they are conveyed in the packet payload.

   Refer to Section 4.4 of [RFC6673] for an expanded discussion of the instruction to 
   "send a Type-P packet back to the Src as quickly as possible" in Section 2.6 of [RFC2681]. 
   Section 8 of [RFC6673] presents additional requirements that MUST be included in the Method 
   of Measurement for this metric.

4.3.2. Packet Stream Generation

   This section provides details regarding packet traffic, which is used as the basis for 
   measurement. In IPPM Metrics, this is called the "stream"; this stream can easily be 
   described by providing the list of stream Parameters.

   Section 3 of [RFC3432] prescribes the method for generating Periodic streams using 
   associated Parameters.

   incT:  
      The nominal duration of the inter-packet interval, first bit to first bit, with value 
      0.0200, expressed in units of seconds, as a positive value of type decimal64 with 
      fraction digits = 4 (see Section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) and with a resolution of 0.0001 
      seconds (0.1 ms).

   dT:
      The duration of the interval for allowed sample start times, with value 1.0, expressed 
      in units of seconds, as a positive value of type decimal64 with fraction digits = 4 (see 
      Section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) and with a resolution of 0.0001 seconds (0.1 ms).

   Note: An initiation process with a number of control exchanges resulting in unpredictable 
   start times (within a time interval) may be sufficient to avoid synchronization of 
   periodic streams and is a valid replacement for selecting a start time at random from 
   a fixed interval.

   The T0 Parameter will be reported as a measured Parameter. Parameters incT and dT are 
   Fixed Parameters.

4.3.5. Runtime Parameters and Data Format

   Runtime Parameters are input factors that must be determined, configured into the measurement 
   system, and reported with the results for the context to be complete.

   Src:
      The IP address of the host in the Src Role (format ipv4‑address-no-zone value for 
      IPv4 or ipv6-address-no-zone value for IPv6; see Section 4 of [RFC6991]).

   Dst:
      The IP address of the host in the Dst Role (format ipv4‑address-no-zone value for 
      IPv4 or ipv6-address-no-zone value for IPv6; see Section 4 of [RFC6991]).

   T0:
      A time, the start of a measurement interval (format "date‑time" as specified in 
      Section 5.6 of [RFC3339]; see also "date‑and‑time" in Section 3 of [RFC6991]). The 
      UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of [RFC2330]. When T0 is "all-zeros", a start 
      time is unspecified and Tf is to be interpreted as the duration of the measurement 
      interval. The start time is controlled through other means.

   Tf:
      A time, the end of a measurement interval (format "date‑time" as specified in 
      Section 5.6 of [RFC3339]; see also "date‑and‑time" in Section 3 of [RFC6991]). The 
      UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of [RFC2330]. When T0 is "all-zeros", an 
      ending time and date is ignored and Tf is interpreted as the duration of the 
      measurement interval.

4.3.6. Roles

   Src:
      Launches each packet and waits for return transmissions from the Dst.

   Dst:
      Waits for each packet from the Src and sends a return packet to the Src.

4.4. Output

   This category specifies all details of the output of measurements using the metric.

4.4.1. Type

   For LossRatio, the count of lost packets to total packets sent is the basis for 
   the loss ratio calculation as per Section 6.1 of [RFC6673].

4.4.2. Reference Definition

   For all outputs:

   T0:
      The start of a measurement interval (format "date‑time" as specified in 
      Section 5.6 of [RFC3339]; see also "date‑and‑time" in Section 3 of [RFC6991]). 
      The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of [RFC2330].

   Tf:
      The end of a measurement interval (format "date‑time" as specified in 
      Section 5.6 of [RFC3339]; see also "date‑and‑time" in Section 3 of [RFC6991]). 
      The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of [RFC2330].

   TotalPkts:
      The count of packets sent by the Src to the Dst during the measurement interval.

   Percent_LossRatio
      The numeric value of the result is expressed in units of lost packets to 
      total packets times 100%, as a positive value of type decimal64 with fraction 
      digits = 9 (see Section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) with a resolution of 0.000000001.

4.4.3. Metric Units

   The round-trip loss ratio is expressed as a percentage of lost packets to total 
   packets sent.

4.4.4. Calibration

   Section 3.7.3 of [RFC7679] provides a means to quantify the systematic and random errors 
   of a time measurement. Calibration in-situ could be enabled with an internal loopback at 
   the Source host that includes as much of the measurement system as possible, performs address 
   manipulation as needed, and provides some form of isolation (e.g., deterministic delay) to 
   avoid send-receive interface contention. Some portion of the random and systematic error can 
   be characterized in this way.

   When a measurement controller requests a calibration measurement, the loopback is applied and 
   the result is output in the same format as a normal measurement, with an additional indication 
   that it is a calibration result.

   Both internal loopback calibration and clock synchronization can be used to estimate the available 
   accuracy of the Output Metric Units. For example, repeated loopback delay measurements will 
   reveal the portion of the output result resolution that is the result of system noise and is 
   thus inaccurate.
