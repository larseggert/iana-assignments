10.1.4. Description

   RTLoss:  This metric assesses the estimated loss count for TCP packets 
   constituting a single connection, exchanged between two hosts. We consider 
   the measurement of round-trip delay based on a single Observation Point (OP)  [RFC7011] somewhere 
   in the network. The output is the estimated loss count for the measurement interval.

10.2. Metric Definition

   This category includes columns to prompt the entry of all necessary
   details related to the metric definition, including the RFC reference
   and values of input factors, called "Fixed Parameters".

10.2.1. Reference Definition

   Almes, G., Kalidindi, S., and M.  Zekauskas, "A Round-trip Delay
   Metric for IPPM", RFC 2681, DOI 10.17487/RFC2681, September 1999,
   <https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc2681>.  [RFC2681]

   Although there is no RFC that describes Passive Measurement of round-
   trip delay, the parallel definition for Active Measurement is
   provided in [RFC2681].

   This metric definition uses the terms "singleton" and "sample" as
   defined in Section 11 of [RFC2330].  (Section 2.4 of [RFC2681]
   provides the reference definition of the singleton (single value)
   round-trip delay metric.  Section 3.4 of [RFC2681] provides the
   reference definition expanded to cover a multi-singleton sample.)

   With the OP [RFC7011] typically located between the hosts
   participating in the TCP connection, the round-trip delay metric
   requires two individual measurements between the OP and each host,
   such that the Spatial Composition [RFC6049] of the measurements yields
   a round-trip delay singleton (we are extending the composition of
   one-way subpath delays to subpath round-trip delay).

   Using the direction of TCP SYN transmission to anchor the
   nomenclature, host A sends the SYN, and host B replies with SYN-ACK
   during connection establishment.  The direction of SYN transfer is
   considered the Forward direction of transmission, from A through the
   OP to B (the Reverse direction is B through the OP to A).

   Traffic Filters reduce the packet streams at the OP to a Qualified
   bidirectional flow of packets.

   In the definitions below, Corresponding Packets are transferred in
   different directions and convey a common value in a TCP header field
   that establishes correspondence (to the extent possible).  Examples
   may be found in the TCP timestamp fields.

The definition of round-trip loss count uses the nomenclature developed above, based on observation of the TCP header sequence numbers and storing the sequence number gaps observed. Packet losses can be inferred from:

Out-of-order segments:
    TCP segments are transmitted with monotonically increasing sequence numbers, but these segments may be received out of order. Section 3 of [RFC4737] describes the notion of "next expected" sequence numbers, which can be adapted to TCP segments (for the purpose of detecting reordered packets). Observation of out-of-order segments indicates loss on the path prior to the OP and creates a gap.

Duplicate segments:
    Section 2 of [RFC5560] defines identical packets and is suitable for evaluation of TCP packets to detect duplication. Observation of segment duplicates a segment previously observed (and thus no corresponding observed segment gap) indicates loss on the path following the OP (e.g., the segment overlaps part of the octet stream already observed at the OP).

Each observation of an out-of-order or duplicate segment infers a singleton of loss, but the composition of round-trip loss counts will be conducted over a measurement interval that is synonymous with a single TCP connection.

With the above observations in the Forward direction over a measurement interval, the count of out-of-order and duplicate segments is defined as RTL_fwd. Comparable observations in the Reverse direction are defined as RTL_rev.

For a measurement interval (corresponding to a single TCP connection) T0 to Tf, the REQUIRED Composition Function for the two single-direction counts of inferred loss is:

RTLoss = RTL_fwd + RTL_rev

10.3. Method of Measurement

   This category includes columns for references to relevant sections of
   the RFC(s) and any supplemental information needed to ensure an
   unambiguous method for implementations.

10.3.1. Reference Methods

   The foundational methodology for this metric is defined in Section 4
   of [RFC7323] using the Timestamps option with modifications that
   allow application at a mid-path OP [RFC7011].  Further details and
   applicable heuristics were derived from [Strowes] and [Trammell-14].

   The Traffic Filter at the OP is configured to observe a single TCP
   connection.  

   For payload-bearing packets,  each observation of an out-of-order or 
   duplicate segment infers a loss count, but the composition of round-trip loss 
   counts will be conducted over a measurement interval that is synonymous 
   with a single TCP connection.
   
   Method for Inferring Loss:

   *  The OP tracks sequence numbers and stores gaps for each direction
      of transmission, as well as the next expected sequence number as
      discussed in [Trammell-14] and [RFC4737].  Loss is inferred from
      out-of-order segments and duplicate segments.

   Loss Measurement Filtering Heuristics:

   *  [Trammell-14] adds a window of evaluation based on the RTDelay.

   *  Distinguish reordered packets from out-of-order segments due to
      loss, because the sequence number gap is filled during the same
      RTDelay window.  Segments detected as reordered according to
      [RFC4737] MUST reduce the loss count inferred from out-of-order
      segments.

   *  Spurious (unneeded) retransmissions (observed as duplicates) can
      also be reduced in this way, as described in [Trammell-14].

  Sources of Error:

   *  A key source of RTLoss error is observation loss, as described in
      Section 3 of [Trammell-14].

10.3.2. Packet Stream Generation

   N/A

10.3.3. Traffic Filtering (Observation) Details

   The Fixed Parameters above give a portion of the Traffic Filter.
   Other aspects will be supplied as Runtime Parameters (below).

10.3.4. Sampling Distribution

   This metric requires a complete sample of all packets that qualify
   according to the Traffic Filter criteria.

10.3.5. Runtime Parameters and Data Format

   Runtime Parameters are input factors that must be determined,
   configured into the measurement system, and reported with the results
   for the context to be complete.

   Src:  The IP address of the host in the host A Role (format
      ipv4-address-no-zone value for IPv4 or ipv6-address-no-zone value
      for IPv6; see Section 4 of [RFC6991]).

   Dst:  The IP address of the host in the host B Role (format
      ipv4-address-no-zone value for IPv4 or ipv6-address-no-zone value
      for IPv6; see Section 4 of [RFC6991]).

   T0:  A time, the start of a measurement interval (format "date-time"
      as specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339]; see also "date-and-time"
      in Section 3 of [RFC6991]).  The UTC Time Zone is required by
      Section 6.1 of [RFC2330].  When T0 is "all-zeros", a start time is
      unspecified and Tf is to be interpreted as the duration of the
      measurement interval.  The start time is controlled through other
      means.

   Tf:  Optionally, the end of a measurement interval (format
      "date-time" as specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339]; see also
      "date-and-time" in Section 3 of [RFC6991]), or the duration (see
      T0).  The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of [RFC2330].
      Alternatively, the end of the measurement interval MAY be
      controlled by the measured connection, where the second pair of
      FIN and ACK packets exchanged between host A and host B
      effectively ends the interval.

   TTL or Hop Limit:  Set at desired value.

10.3.6. Roles

   host A:  Launches the SYN packet to open the connection.  The Role of
      "host A" is synonymous with the IP address used at host A.

   host B:  Replies with the SYN-ACK packet to open the connection.  The
      Role of "host B" is synonymous with the IP address used at host B.

10.4. Output

   This category specifies all details of the output of measurements
   using the metric.

10.4.1. Type

   For RTLoss: The count of lost packets.

10.4.2. Reference Definition

   For all output types:

   T0:  The start of a measurement interval (format "date-time" as
      specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339]; see also "date-and-time" in
      Section 3 of [RFC6991]).  The UTC Time Zone is required by
      Section 6.1 of [RFC2330].

   Tf:  The end of a measurement interval (format "date-time" as
      specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339]; see also "date-and-time" in
      Section 3 of [RFC6991]).  The UTC Time Zone is required by
      Section 6.1 of [RFC2330].  The end of the measurement interval MAY
      be controlled by the measured connection, where the second pair of
      FIN and ACK packets exchanged between host A and host B
      effectively ends the interval.

   RTLoss_Passive_IP-TCP_RFC8912sec10_Packet_Count: The count of lost packets.

   Observation of an out-of-order segment or duplicate segment infers a
   loss count, after application of the Definitions of Section 10.2.1 and the Loss Measurement 
   Filtering Heuristics of Section 10.3.1.  The composition of round-trip loss counts will
   be conducted over a measurement interval that is synonymous with a
   single TCP connection.

   For a measurement interval (corresponding to a single TCP connection)
   T0 to Tf, the REQUIRED Composition Function for the two single-
   direction counts of inferred loss is:

   RTLoss = RTL_fwd + RTL_rev

   Packet count:  The numeric value of the result is expressed in units
      of lost packets, as a positive value of type uint64 (represents
      integer values between 0 and 18446744073709551615, inclusively
      (see Section 9.2 of [RFC6020]). 

10.4.3. Metric Units

   The round-trip loss count is expressed as a number of packets.
   
10.4.4. Calibration

   Passive Measurements at an OP could be calibrated against an Active
   Measurement (with loss emulation) at host A or host B, where the
   Active Measurement represents the ground truth.
