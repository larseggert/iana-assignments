   perspective, for a specific named resource. The metric can be measured 
   repeatedly using different resource names.

   RTDNS:
   This metric assesses the response time, the interval from the query 
   transmission to the response.

6.2. Metric Definition

   This category includes columns to prompt the entry of all necessary 
   details related to the metric definition, including the RFC reference 
   and values of input factors, called "Fixed Parameters".

6.2.1. Reference Definition

   Mockapetris, P., "Domain names - implementation and specification", 
   STD 13, RFC 1035, DOI 10.17487/RFC1035, November 1987, 
   <https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc1035> (and updates). [RFC1035]

   Almes, G., Kalidindi, S., and M. Zekauskas, "A Round-trip Delay 
   Metric for IPPM", RFC 2681, DOI 10.17487/RFC2681, September 1999, 
   <https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc2681>. [RFC2681]

   Section 2.4 of [RFC2681] provides the reference definition of the 
   singleton (single value) round-trip delay metric. Section 3.4 of 
   [RFC2681] provides the reference definition expanded to cover a 
   multi-singleton sample. Note that terms such as "singleton" and 
   "sample" are defined in Section 11 of [RFC2330].

   For DNS Response Latency, the entities in [RFC1035] must be mapped 
   to [RFC2681]. The Local Host with its User Program and Resolver 
   take the Role of "Src", and the Foreign Name Server takes the Role 
   of "Dst".

   Note that although the definition of round-trip delay between the 
   Source (Src) and the Destination (Dst) at T as provided in 
   Section 2.4 of [RFC2681] is directionally ambiguous in the text, 
   this metric tightens the definition further to recognize that the 
   host in the Src Role will send the first packet to the host in the 
   Dst Role and will ultimately receive the corresponding return packet 
   from the Dst (when neither is lost).

      QCLASS:  Set to 1 for IN

   The other sections do not contain any Resource Records (RRs).

Other measurement Parameters:

   Tmax:  A loss threshold waiting time (and to help disambiguate queries). 
   The value is 5.0, expressed in units of seconds, as a positive value of type 
   decimal64 with fraction digits = 4 (see Section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) and with 
   a resolution of 0.0001 seconds (0.1 ms), with lossless conversion to/from 
   the 32-bit NTP timestamp as per Section 6 of [RFC5905].

Observation:  Reply packets will contain a DNS Response and may contain RRs.

6.3. Method of Measurement

   This category includes columns for references to relevant sections of 
   the RFC(s) and any supplemental information needed to ensure an unambiguous 
   method for implementations.

6.3.1. Reference Methods

   The methodology for this metric (equivalent to 
   Type-P-Round-trip-Delay-Poisson-Stream) is defined as in Section 2.6 
   of [RFC2681] (for singletons) and Section 3.6 of [RFC2681] (for samples) 
   using the Type-P and Timeout defined in the Fixed Parameters column.

   The reference method distinguishes between long-delayed packets and 
   lost packets by implementing a maximum waiting time for packet arrival. 
   Tmax is the waiting time used as the threshold to declare a response 
   packet lost. Lost packets SHALL be designated as having undefined delay 
   and counted for the RLDNS metric.

   The calculations on the delay (RTT) SHALL be performed on the conditional 
   distribution, conditioned on successful packet arrival within Tmax. Also, 
   when all packet delays are stored, the process that calculates the RTT 
   value MUST enforce the Tmax threshold on stored values before calculations. 
   See Section 4.1 of [RFC3393] for details on the conditional distribution 
   to exclude undefined values of delay, and see Section 5 of [RFC6703] for 
   background on this analysis choice.

   The reference method requires some way to distinguish between different 
   packets in a stream to establish correspondence between sending times 
   and receiving times for each successfully arriving reply.

   DNS messages bearing queries provide for random ID Numbers in the 
   Identification header field, so more than one query may be launched 
   while a previous request is outstanding when the ID Number is used. 
   Therefore, the ID Number MUST be retained at the Src and included with 
   each response packet to disambiguate packet reordering if it occurs.

   If a DNS Response does not arrive within Tmax, the response time RTDNS 
   is undefined, and RLDNS = 1. The Message ID SHALL be used to disambiguate 
   the successive queries that are otherwise identical.

   Since the ID Number field is only 16 bits in length, it places a limit on 
   the number of simultaneous outstanding DNS queries during a stress test 
   from a single Src address.

   Refer to Section 4.4 of [RFC6673] for an expanded discussion of the 
   instruction to "send a Type-P packet back to the Src as quickly as possible" 
   in Section 2.6 of [RFC2681]. However, the DNS server is expected to perform 
   all required functions to prepare and send a response, so the response time 
   will include processing time and network delay. Section 8 of [RFC6673] 
   presents additional requirements that SHALL be included in the Method of 
   Measurement for this metric.

   In addition to operations described in [RFC2681], the Src MUST parse the 
   DNS headers of the reply and prepare the query response information for 
   subsequent reporting as a measured result, along with the round-trip delay.

6.3.2. Packet Stream Generation

   This section provides details regarding packet traffic, which is used as 
   the basis for measurement. In IPPM Metrics, this is called the "stream"; this 
   stream can easily be described by providing the list of stream Parameters.

   Section 11.1.3 of [RFC2330] provides three methods to generate Poisson 
   sampling intervals. The reciprocal of lambda is the average packet spacing; 
   thus, the Runtime Parameter is Reciprocal_lambda = 1⁠/lambda, in seconds.

   Method 3 SHALL be used. Where given a start time (Runtime Parameter), the 
   subsequent send times are all computed prior to measurement by computing 
   the pseudorandom distribution of inter-packet send times (truncating the 
   distribution as specified in the Parameter Trunc), and the Src sends each 
   packet at the computed times.

   Note that Trunc is the upper limit on inter-packet times in the Poisson 
   distribution. A random value greater than Trunc is set equal to Trunc 
   instead.

6.3.5. Runtime Parameters and Data Format

   Runtime Parameters are input factors that must be determined, configured 
   into the measurement system, and reported with the results for the context 
   to be complete.

   Src:  The IP address of the host in the Src Role (format ipv4‑address-no-zone 
   value for IPv4 or ipv6-address-no-zone value for IPv6; see Section 4 of 
   [RFC6991]).

   Dst:  The IP address of the host in the Dst Role (format ipv4‑address-no-zone 
   value for IPv4 or ipv6-address-no-zone value for IPv6; see Section 4 of 
   [RFC6991]).

   T0:  A time, the start of a measurement interval (format "date‑time" as 
   specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339]; see also "date‑and‑time" in Section 3 of
   [RFC6991]). The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of [RFC2330]. When 
   T0 is "all-zeros", a start time is unspecified and Tf is to be interpreted 
   as the duration of the measurement interval. The start time is controlled 
   through other means.

   Tf:  A time, the end of a measurement interval (format "date‑time" as 
   specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339]; see also "date‑and‑time" in Section 3 of
   [RFC6991]). The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of [RFC2330]. When T0 
   is "all-zeros", an ending time and date is ignored and Tf is interpreted as the
   duration of the measurement interval.

   Reciprocal_lambda:  Average packet interval for Poisson streams, expressed 
   in units of seconds, as a positive value of type decimal64 with fraction 
   digits = 4 (see Section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) with a resolution of 0.0001 
   seconds (0.1 ms), and with lossless conversion to/from the 32-bit NTP 
   timestamp as per Section 6 of [RFC5905].

   Trunc:  Upper limit on Poisson distribution, expressed in units of seconds, 
   as a positive value of type decimal64 with fraction digits = 4 (see Section 
   9.3 of [RFC6020]) with a resolution of 0.0001 seconds (0.1 ms), and with 
   lossless conversion to/from the 32-bit NTP timestamp as per Section 6 of 
   [RFC5905] (values above this limit will be clipped and set to the limit value).

   ID:  The 16-bit Identifier assigned by the program that generates the query. 
   The ID value must vary in successive queries (a list of IDs is needed); see 
   Section 4.1.1 of [RFC1035]. This Identifier is copied into the corresponding 
   reply and can be used by the requester (Src) to match replies with any 
   outstanding queries.

   QNAME:  The domain name of the query, formatted as specified in Section 4 
   of [RFC6991].

   QTYPE:  The query type, which will correspond to the IP address family of 
   the query (decimal 1 for IPv4 or 28 for IPv6), formatted as a uint16, as 
   per Section 9.2 of [RFC6020].

6.3.6. Roles

   Src:  Launches each packet and waits for return transmissions from the Dst.

   Dst:  Waits for each packet from the Src and sends a return packet to the Src.

6.4. Output

   This category specifies all details of the output of measurements using 
   the metric.

6.4.1. Type

   Raw: For each DNS query packet sent, sets of values as defined in the 
   next column, including the status of the response, only assigning delay 
   values to successful query-response pairs.

6.4.2. Reference Definition

  For all outputs:

   T:  The time the DNS query was sent during the measurement interval 
   (format "date‑time" as specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339]; see also 
   "date‑and‑time" in Section 3 of [RFC6991]). The UTC Time Zone is 
   required by Section 6.1 of [RFC2330].

   dT:  The time value of the round-trip delay to receive the DNS Response, 
   expressed in units of seconds, as a positive value of type decimal64 with 
   fraction digits = 9 (see Section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) with a resolution of 
   0.000000001 seconds (1.0 ns), and with lossless conversion to/from the 
   64-bit NTP timestamp as per Section 6 of [RFC5905]. This value is 
   undefined when the response packet is not received at the Src within a 
   waiting time of Tmax seconds.

   RCODE:  The value of the RCODE field in the DNS Response header, expressed 
   as a uint64 as specified in Section 9.2 of [RFC6020]. Non-zero values 
   convey errors in the response, and such replies must be analyzed separately 
   from successful requests.

6.4.3. Metric Units

   RTDNS:  Round-trip delay, dT, is expressed in seconds.

6.4.4. Calibration

   Section 3.7.3 of [RFC7679] provides a means to quantify the systematic 
   and random errors of a time measurement. Calibration in-situ could be 
   enabled with an internal loopback at the Source host that includes as 
   much of the measurement system as possible, performs address and payload 
   manipulation as needed, and provides some form of isolation (e.g., 
   deterministic delay) to avoid send-receive interface contention. Some 
   portion of the random and systematic error can be characterized in this 
   way.

   When a measurement controller requests a calibration measurement, the 
   loopback is applied and the result is output in the same format as a 
   normal measurement, with an additional indication that it is a calibration 
   result.

   Both internal loopback calibration and clock synchronization can be used 
   to estimate the available accuracy of the Output Metric Units. For example, 
   repeated loopback delay measurements will reveal the portion of the output 
   result resolution that is the result of system noise and is thus inaccurate.
