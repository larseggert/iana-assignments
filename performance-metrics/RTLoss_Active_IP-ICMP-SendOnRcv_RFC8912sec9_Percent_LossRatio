9.1.4. Description

   RTLoss:
   This metric assesses the loss ratio of a stream of ICMP packets exchanged between two hosts (which are the
   two measurement points). The output is the round-trip loss ratio for all transmitted packets expressed as 
   a percentage.

9.2. Metric Definition

   This category includes columns to prompt the entry of all necessary details related to the metric 
   definition, including the RFC reference and values of input factors, called "Fixed Parameters".

9.2.1. Reference Definition

   Almes, G., Kalidindi, S., and M. Zekauskas, "A Round-trip Delay Metric for IPPM", RFC 2681, 
   DOI 10.17487/RFC2681, September 1999, <https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc2681>. [RFC2681]

   Section 2.4 of [RFC2681] provides the reference definition of the singleton (single value) 
   round-trip delay metric. Section 3.4 of [RFC2681] provides the reference definition expanded to 
   cover a multi-singleton sample. Note that terms such as "singleton" and "sample" are defined in 
   Section 11 of [RFC2330].

   Note that although the definition of round-trip delay between the Source (Src) and the 
   Destination (Dst) as provided in Section 2.4 of [RFC2681] is directionally ambiguous in the text, 
   this metric tightens the definition further to recognize that the host in the Src Role will send the 
   first packet to the host in the Dst Role and will ultimately receive the corresponding return packet 
   from the Dst (when neither is lost).

   Finally, note that the variable "dT" is used in [RFC2681] to refer to the value of round-trip delay 
   in metric definitions and methods. The variable "dT" has been reused in other IPPM literature to 
   refer to different quantities and cannot be used as a global variable name.

   Morton, A., "Round-Trip Packet Loss Metrics", RFC 6673, DOI 10.17487/RFC6673, August 2012, 
   <https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc6673>. [RFC6673]

   Both Delay and Loss metrics employ a maximum waiting time for received packets, so the count of lost 
   packets to total packets sent is the basis for the loss ratio calculation as per Section 6.1 of 
   [RFC6673].

   value of type decimal64 with fraction digits = 4 (see Section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) and with a resolution 
   of 0.0001 seconds (0.1 ms), with lossless conversion to/from the 32-bit NTP timestamp as per 
   Section 6 of [RFC5905].

9.3. Method of Measurement

   This category includes columns for references to relevant sections of the RFC(s) and any supplemental 
   information needed to ensure an unambiguous method for implementations.

9.3.1. Reference Methods

   The methodology for this metric (equivalent to Type-P-Round-trip-Delay-Poisson-Stream) is defined as 
   in Section 2.6 of [RFC2681] (for singletons) and Section 3.6 of [RFC2681] (for samples) using the 
   Type-P and Tmax defined in the Fixed Parameters column.

   The reference method distinguishes between long-delayed packets and lost packets by implementing a 
   maximum waiting time for packet arrival. Tmax is the waiting time used as the threshold to declare 
   a packet lost. Lost packets SHALL be designated as having undefined delay and counted for the RTLoss 
   metric.

   The calculations on the delay (RTD) SHALL be performed on the conditional distribution, conditioned on
   successful packet arrival within Tmax. Also, when all packet delays are stored, the process that 
   calculates the RTD value MUST enforce the Tmax threshold on stored values before calculations. See 
   Section 4.1 of [RFC3393] for details on the conditional distribution to exclude undefined values of 
   delay, and see Section 5 of [RFC6703] for background on this analysis choice.

   The reference method requires some way to distinguish between different packets in a stream to establish
   correspondence between sending times and receiving times for each successfully arriving packet. Sequence
   numbers or other send-order identification MUST be retained at the Src or included with each packet to
   disambiguate packet reordering if it occurs.

   The measurement process will determine the sequence numbers applied to test packets after the Fixed and 
   Runtime Parameters are passed to that process. The ICMP measurement process and protocol will dictate 
   the format of sequence numbers and other Identifiers.

   Refer to Section 4.4 of [RFC6673] for an expanded discussion of the instruction to "send a Type-P packet 
   back to the Src as quickly as possible" in Section 2.6 of [RFC2681]. Section 8 of [RFC6673] presents 
   additional requirements that MUST be included in the Method of Measurement for this metric.

9.3.2. Packet Stream Generation

   This section provides details regarding packet traffic, which is used as the basis for measurement. 
   In IPPM Metrics, this is called the "stream"; this stream can easily be described by providing the 
   list of stream Parameters.

   The ICMP metrics use a sending discipline called "SendOnRcv" or Send On Receive. This is a modification 
   of Section 3 of [RFC3432], which prescribes the method for generating Periodic streams using associated 
   Parameters as defined below for this description:

   incT:  The nominal duration of the inter-packet interval, first bit to first bit.

   dT:  The duration of the interval for allowed sample start times.

   The incT stream Parameter will be specified as a Runtime Parameter, and dT is not used in SendOnRcv.

   A SendOnRcv sender behaves exactly like a Periodic stream generator while all reply packets arrive 
   with RTD < incT, and the inter-packet interval will be constant.

   If a reply packet arrives with RTD >= incT, then the inter-packet interval for the next sending time is
   nominally RTD.

   If a reply packet fails to arrive within Tmax, then the inter-packet interval for the next sending time 
   is nominally Tmax.

   If an immediate Send On Reply arrival is desired, then set incT = 0.

9.3.5. Runtime Parameters and Data Format

   Runtime Parameters are input factors that must be determined, configured into the measurement system, 
   and reported with the results for the context to be complete.

   Src:  The IP address of the host in the Src Role (format ipv4‑address-no-zone value for IPv4 or 
   ipv6-address-no-zone value for IPv6; see Section 4 of [RFC6991]).

   Dst:  The IP address of the host in the Dst Role (format ipv4‑address-no-zone value for IPv4 or 
   ipv6-address-no-zone value for IPv6; see Section 4 of [RFC6991]).

   incT:  The nominal duration of the inter-packet interval, first bit to first bit, expressed in units of
   seconds, as a positive value of type decimal64 with fraction digits = 4 (see Section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) 
   and with a resolution of 0.0001 seconds (0.1 ms).

   T0:  A time, the start of a measurement interval (format "date‑time" as specified in Section 5.6 of
   [RFC3339]; see also "date‑and‑time" in Section 3 of [RFC6991]). The UTC Time Zone is required by 
   Section 6.1 of [RFC2330]. When T0 is "all-zeros", a start time is unspecified and Tf is to be 
   interpreted as the duration of the measurement interval. The start time is controlled through other 
   means.

   Count:  The total count of ICMP Echo Requests to send, formatted as a uint16, as per Section 9.2 
   of [RFC6020].

   See the Packet Stream Generation section for additional Runtime Parameters.

9.3.6. Roles

   Src:  Launches each packet and waits for return transmissions from the Dst.

   Dst:  Waits for each packet from the Src and sends a return packet to the Src (ICMP Echo Reply, Type 0).

9.4. Output

   This category specifies all details of the output of measurements using the metric.

9.4.1. Type

   For LossRatio, the count of lost packets to total packets sent is the basis for the loss ratio 
   calculation as per Section 6.1 of [RFC6673].

9.4.2. Reference Definition

   For all output types:

   T0:  The start of a measurement interval (format "date‑time" as specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339]; 
   see also "date‑and‑time" in Section 3 of [RFC6991]). The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of 
   [RFC2330].

   Tf:  The end of a measurement interval (format "date‑time" as specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339]; 
   see also "date‑and‑time" in Section 3 of [RFC6991]). The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of 
   [RFC2330].

   TotalCount:
   The count of packets actually sent by the Src to the Dst during the measurement interval.

   For LossRatio, the count of lost packets to total packets sent is the basis for the loss ratio 
   calculation as per Section 4.1 of [RFC7680].

   Percent_LossRatio:
   The numeric value of the result is expressed in units of lost packets to total packets times 100%, 
   as a positive value of type decimal64 with fraction digits = 9 (see Section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) with a 
   resolution of 0.000000001.

9.4.3. Metric Units

   The round-trip loss ratio is expressed as a percentage of lost packets to total packets sent.

9.4.4. Calibration

   Section 3.7.3 of [RFC7679] provides a means to quantify the systematic and random errors of a time 
   measurement. Calibration in-situ could be enabled with an internal loopback at the Source host that 
   includes as much of the measurement system as possible, performs address manipulation as needed, and 
   provides some form of isolation (e.g., deterministic delay) to avoid send-receive interface contention. 
   Some portion of the random and systematic error can be characterized in this way.

   When a measurement controller requests a calibration measurement, the loopback is applied and the result 
   is output in the same format as a normal measurement, with an additional indication that it is a 
   calibration result.

   Both internal loopback calibration and clock synchronization can be used to estimate the available 
   accuracy of the Output Metric Units. For example, repeated loopback delay measurements will reveal the
   portion of the output result resolution that is the result of system noise and is thus inaccurate.
