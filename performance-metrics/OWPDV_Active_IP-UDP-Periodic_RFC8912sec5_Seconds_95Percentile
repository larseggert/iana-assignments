   differences are referred to by the variable name "ddT" (applicable to all 
   forms of delay variation). However, this Metric Entry specifies the PDV 
   form defined in Section 4.2 of [RFC5481], where the singleton PDV for 
   packet i is referred to by the variable name "PDV(i)".

   of seconds, as a positive value of type decimal64 with fraction digits 
   = 4 (see Section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) and with a resolution of 0.0001 
   seconds (0.1 ms), with lossless conversion to/from the 32-bit NTP 
   timestamp as per Section 6 of [RFC5905].

   stream selected for the metric. See Section 4.2 of [RFC5481] for the 
   PDV form.

   See the Packet Stream Generation section for two additional 
   Fixed Parameters.

5.3. Method of Measurement

   This category includes columns for references to relevant sections of 
   the RFC(s) and any supplemental information needed to ensure an unambiguous 
   method for implementations.

5.3.1. Reference Methods

   See Sections 2.6 and 3.6 of [RFC3393] for general singleton element 
   calculations. This Metric Entry requires implementation of the PDV 
   form defined in Section 4.2 of [RFC5481]. Also see measurement 
   considerations in Section 8 of [RFC5481].

   The reference method distinguishes between long-delayed packets and 
   lost packets by implementing a maximum waiting time for packet arrival. 
   Tmax is the waiting time used as the threshold to declare a packet 
   lost. Lost packets SHALL be designated as having undefined delay.

   The calculations on the one-way delay SHALL be performed on the 
   conditional distribution, conditioned on successful packet arrival 
   within Tmax. Also, when all packet delays are stored, the process that 
   calculates the one-way delay value MUST enforce the Tmax threshold 
   on stored values before calculations. See Section 4.1 of [RFC3393] 
   for details on the conditional distribution to exclude undefined 
   values of delay, and see Section 5 of [RFC6703] for background on 
   this analysis choice.

   The reference method requires some way to distinguish between 
   different packets in a stream to establish correspondence between 
   sending times and receiving times for each successfully arriving 
   packet. Sequence numbers or other send-order identification MUST be 
   retained at the Src or included with each packet to disambiguate 
   packet reordering if it occurs.

   If a standard measurement protocol is employed, then the measurement 
   process will determine the sequence numbers or timestamps applied to 
   test packets after the Fixed and Runtime Parameters are passed to 
   that process. The chosen measurement protocol will dictate the format 
   of sequence numbers and timestamps, if they are conveyed in the 
   packet payload.

5.3.2. Packet Stream Generation

   This section provides details regarding packet traffic, which is used 
   as the basis for measurement. In IPPM Metrics, this is called the 
   "stream"; this stream can easily be described by providing the list 
   of stream Parameters.

   Section 3 of [RFC3432] prescribes the method for generating Periodic
   streams using associated Parameters.

   incT: The nominal duration of the inter-packet interval, first bit to 
   first bit, with value 0.0200, expressed in units of seconds, as a 
   positive value of type decimal64 with fraction digits = 4 (see Section 
   9.3 of [RFC6020]) and with a resolution of 0.0001 seconds (0.1 ms).

   dT: The duration of the interval for allowed sample start times, with 
   value 1.0, expressed in units of seconds, as a positive value of type 
   decimal64 with fraction digits = 4 (see Section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) and 
   with a resolution of 0.0001 seconds (0.1 ms).

      Note: An initiation process with a number of control exchanges resulting 
      in unpredictable start times (within a time interval) may be sufficient 
      to avoid synchronization of periodic streams and is a valid replacement 
      for selecting a start time at random from a fixed interval.

   The T0 Parameter will be reported as a measured Parameter. Parameters incT 
   and dT are Fixed Parameters.

5.3.3. Traffic Filtering (Observation) Details

   N/A

5.3.4. Sampling Distribution

   N/A

5.3.5. Runtime Parameters and Data Format

   Src: The IP address of the host in the Src Role (format 
   ipv4‑address-no-zone value for IPv4 or ipv6-address-no-zone value for 
   IPv6; see Section 4 of [RFC6991]).

   Dst: The IP address of the host in the Dst Role (format 
   ipv4‑address-no-zone value for IPv4 or ipv6-address-no-zone value for 
   IPv6; see Section 4 of [RFC6991]).

   T0: A time, the start of a measurement interval (format "date‑time" 
   as specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339]; see also "date‑and‑time" in 
   Section 3 of [RFC6991]). The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 
   of [RFC2330]. When T0 is "all-zeros", a start time is unspecified and 
   Tf is to be interpreted as the duration of the measurement interval. 
   The start time is controlled through other means.

   Tf: A time, the end of a measurement interval (format "date‑time" as 
   specified in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339]; see also "date‑and‑time" in 
   Section 3 of [RFC6991]). The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 
   of [RFC2330]. When T0 is "all-zeros", an ending time and date is 
   ignored and Tf is interpreted as the duration of the measurement 
   interval.

5.3.6. Roles

   Src: Launches each packet and waits for return transmissions from the Dst.

   Dst: Waits for each packet from the Src and sends a return packet to the 
   Src (when required by the test protocol).

5.4. Output

   This category specifies all details of the output of measurements using 
   the metric.

5.4.1. Type

   Percentile: For the conditional distribution of all packets with a valid 
   value of one-way delay (undefined delays are excluded), this is a single 
   value corresponding to the 95th percentile, as follows:

   See Section 4.1 of [RFC3393] for details on the conditional distribution 
   to exclude undefined values of delay, and see Section 5 of [RFC6703] for 
   background on this analysis choice.

   The percentile = 95, meaning that the reported delay, "95Percentile", is 
   the smallest value of one-way PDV for which the Empirical Distribution 
   Function, EDF(95Percentile), is greater than or equal to 95% of the 
   singleton one-way PDV values in the conditional distribution. See 
   Section 11.3 of [RFC2330] for the definition of the percentile statistic 
   using the EDF.

5.4.2. Reference Definition

   T0: The start of a measurement interval (format "date‑time" as specified 
   in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339]; see also "date‑and‑time" in Section 3 of 
   [RFC6991]). The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of [RFC2330].

   Tf: The end of a measurement interval (format "date‑time" as specified 
   in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339]; see also "date‑and‑time" in Section 3 of 
   [RFC6991]). The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of [RFC2330].

   95Percentile: The time value of the result is expressed in units of 
   seconds, as a positive value of type decimal64 with fraction 
   digits = 9 (see Section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) with a resolution of 
   0.000000001 seconds (1.0 ns), and with lossless conversion to/from the 
   64-bit NTP timestamp as per Section 6 of [RFC5905].

5.4.3. Metric Units

   The 95th percentile of one-way PDV is expressed in seconds.

5.4.4. Calibration

   Section 3.7.3 of [RFC7679] provides a means to quantify the systematic 
   and random errors of a time measurement. Calibration in-situ could be 
   enabled with an internal loopback that includes as much of the 
   measurement system as possible, performs address manipulation as needed, 
   and provides some form of isolation (e.g., deterministic delay) to 
   avoid send-receive interface contention. Some portion of the random and 
   systematic error can be characterized in this way.

   For one-way delay measurements, the error calibration must include an 
   assessment of the internal clock synchronization with its external 
   reference (this internal clock is supplying timestamps for measurement). 
   In practice, the time offsets [RFC5905] of clocks at both the Source 
   and Destination are needed to estimate the systematic error due to 
   imperfect clock synchronization (the time offsets are smoothed; thus, 
   the random variation is not usually represented in the results).

   time_offset: The time value of the result is expressed in units of seconds, 
   as a signed value of type decimal64 with fraction digits = 9 (see Section 
   9.3 of [RFC6020]) with a resolution of 0.000000001 seconds (1.0 ns), and 
   with lossless conversion to/from the 64-bit NTP timestamp as per 
   Section 6 of [RFC5905].

   When a measurement controller requests a calibration measurement, the 
   loopback is applied and the result is output in the same format as a 
   normal measurement, with an additional indication that it is a calibration 
   result. In any measurement, the measurement function SHOULD report its 
   current estimate of the time offset [RFC5905] as an indicator of the 
   degree of synchronization.

   Both internal loopback calibration and clock synchronization can be used 
   to estimate the available accuracy of the Output Metric Units. For example, 
   repeated loopback delay measurements will reveal the portion of the 
   output result resolution that is the result of system noise and is thus 
   inaccurate.
