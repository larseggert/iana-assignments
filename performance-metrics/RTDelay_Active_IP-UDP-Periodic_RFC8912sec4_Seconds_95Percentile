4.1.4. Description

   RTDelay:
    This metric assesses the delay of a stream of packets exchanged between two hosts (which 
    are the two measurement points). The output is the round-trip delay for all successfully 
    exchanged packets expressed as the 95th percentile of their conditional delay distribution.

4.2. Metric Definition

   This category includes columns to prompt the entry of all necessary details related to the metric 
   definition, including the RFC reference and values of input factors, called "Fixed Parameters".

4.2.1. Reference Definition

   Almes, G., Kalidindi, S., and M. Zekauskas, "A Round-trip Delay Metric for IPPM", RFC 2681, 
   DOI 10.17487/RFC2681, September 1999, <https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc2681>. [RFC2681]

   Section 2.4 of [RFC2681] provides the reference definition of the singleton (single value) 
   round-trip delay metric. Section 3.4 of [RFC2681] provides the reference definition expanded to 
   cover a multi-singleton sample. Note that terms such as "singleton" and "sample" are defined in 
   Section 11 of [RFC2330].

   Note that although the definition of round-trip delay between the Source (Src) and the Destination 
   (Dst) as provided in Section 2.4 of [RFC2681] is directionally ambiguous in the text, this metric 
   tightens the definition further to recognize that the host in the Src Role will send the first 
   packet to the host in the Dst Role and will ultimately receive the corresponding return packet 
   from the Dst (when neither is lost).

   Finally, note that the variable "dT" is used in [RFC2681] to refer to the value of round-trip 
   delay in metric definitions and methods. The variable "dT" has been reused in other IPPM literature 
   to refer to different quantities and cannot be used as a global variable name.

   Both Delay and Loss metrics employ a maximum waiting time for received packets, so the count of 
   lost packets to total packets sent is the basis for the loss ratio calculation as per Section 6.1 
   of [RFC6673].

4.2.2. Fixed Parameters

   Other measurement Parameters:

   Tmax:
      A loss threshold waiting time with value 3.0, expressed in units of seconds, as a positive 
      value of type decimal64 with fraction digits = 4 (see Section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) and with a 
      resolution of 0.0001 seconds (0.1 ms), with lossless conversion to/from the 32-bit NTP 
      timestamp as per Section 6 of [RFC5905].

4.3. Method of Measurement

   This category includes columns for references to relevant sections of the RFC(s) and 
   any supplemental information needed to ensure an unambiguous method for implementations.

4.3.1. Reference Methods

   The methodology for this metric (equivalent to Type-P-Round-trip- Delay and 
   Type-P-Round-trip-Delay-Poisson-Stream) is defined as in Section 2.6 of [RFC2681] 
   (for singletons) and Section 3.6 of [RFC2681] (for samples) using the Type-P and 
   Tmax defined in the Fixed Parameters column. However, the Periodic stream will be 
   generated according to [RFC3432].

   The reference method distinguishes between long-delayed packets and lost packets by 
   implementing a maximum waiting time for packet arrival. Tmax is the waiting time used 
   as the threshold to declare a packet lost. Lost packets SHALL be designated as having 
   undefined delay and counted for the RTLoss metric.

   The calculations on the delay (RTT) SHALL be performed on the conditional distribution, 
   conditioned on successful packet arrival within Tmax. Also, when all packet delays are 
   stored, the process that calculates the RTT value MUST enforce the Tmax threshold on 
   stored values before calculations. See Section 4.1 of [RFC3393] for details on the 
   conditional distribution to exclude undefined values of delay, and see Section 5 of 
   [RFC6703] for background on this analysis choice.

   The reference method requires some way to distinguish between different packets in a 
   stream to establish correspondence between sending times and receiving times for each 
   successfully arriving packet. Sequence numbers or other send-order identification MUST 
   be retained at the Src or included with each packet to disambiguate packet reordering 
   if it occurs.

   If a standard measurement protocol is employed, then the measurement process will determine 
   the sequence numbers or timestamps applied to test packets after the Fixed and Runtime 
   Parameters are passed to that process. The chosen measurement protocol will dictate the 
   format of sequence numbers and timestamps, if they are conveyed in the packet payload.

   Refer to Section 4.4 of [RFC6673] for an expanded discussion of the instruction to 
   "send a Type-P packet back to the Src as quickly as possible" in Section 2.6 of [RFC2681]. 
   Section 8 of [RFC6673] presents additional requirements that MUST be included in the Method 
   of Measurement for this metric.

4.3.2. Packet Stream Generation

   This section provides details regarding packet traffic, which is used as the basis for 
   measurement. In IPPM Metrics, this is called the "stream"; this stream can easily be 
   described by providing the list of stream Parameters.

   Section 3 of [RFC3432] prescribes the method for generating Periodic streams using 
   associated Parameters.

   incT:  
      The nominal duration of the inter-packet interval, first bit to first bit, with value 
      0.0200, expressed in units of seconds, as a positive value of type decimal64 with 
      fraction digits = 4 (see Section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) and with a resolution of 0.0001 
      seconds (0.1 ms).

   dT:
      The duration of the interval for allowed sample start times, with value 1.0, expressed 
      in units of seconds, as a positive value of type decimal64 with fraction digits = 4 (see 
      Section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) and with a resolution of 0.0001 seconds (0.1 ms).

   Note: An initiation process with a number of control exchanges resulting in unpredictable 
   start times (within a time interval) may be sufficient to avoid synchronization of 
   periodic streams and is a valid replacement for selecting a start time at random from 
   a fixed interval.

   The T0 Parameter will be reported as a measured Parameter. Parameters incT and dT are 
   Fixed Parameters.

4.3.5. Runtime Parameters and Data Format

   Runtime Parameters are input factors that must be determined, configured into the measurement 
   system, and reported with the results for the context to be complete.

   Src:
      The IP address of the host in the Src Role (format ipv4‑address-no-zone value for 
      IPv4 or ipv6-address-no-zone value for IPv6; see Section 4 of [RFC6991]).

   Dst:
      The IP address of the host in the Dst Role (format ipv4‑address-no-zone value for 
      IPv4 or ipv6-address-no-zone value for IPv6; see Section 4 of [RFC6991]).

   T0:
      A time, the start of a measurement interval (format "date‑time" as specified in 
      Section 5.6 of [RFC3339]; see also "date‑and‑time" in Section 3 of [RFC6991]). The 
      UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of [RFC2330]. When T0 is "all-zeros", a start 
      time is unspecified and Tf is to be interpreted as the duration of the measurement 
      interval. The start time is controlled through other means.

   Tf:
      A time, the end of a measurement interval (format "date‑time" as specified in 
      Section 5.6 of [RFC3339]; see also "date‑and‑time" in Section 3 of [RFC6991]). The 
      UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of [RFC2330]. When T0 is "all-zeros", an 
      ending time and date is ignored and Tf is interpreted as the duration of the 
      measurement interval.

4.3.6. Roles

   Src:
      Launches each packet and waits for return transmissions from the Dst.

   Dst:
      Waits for each packet from the Src and sends a return packet to the Src.

4.4. Output

   This category specifies all details of the output of measurements using the metric.

4.4.1. Type

   Percentile: For the conditional distribution of all packets with a valid value 
   of round-trip delay (undefined delays are excluded), this is a single value 
   corresponding to the 95th percentile, as follows:

   See Section 4.1 of [RFC3393] for details on the conditional distribution to exclude 
   undefined values of delay, and see Section 5 of [RFC6703] for background on this 
   analysis choice.

   The percentile = 95, meaning that the reported delay, "95Percentile", is the smallest 
   value of round-trip delay for which the Empirical Distribution Function, 
   EDF(95Percentile), is greater than or equal to 95% of the singleton round-trip delay 
   values in the conditional distribution. See Section 11.3 of [RFC2330] for the definition 
   of the percentile statistic using the EDF.


4.4.2. Reference Definition

   For all outputs:

   T0:
      The start of a measurement interval (format "date‑time" as specified in 
      Section 5.6 of [RFC3339]; see also "date‑and‑time" in Section 3 of [RFC6991]). 
      The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of [RFC2330].

   Tf:
      The end of a measurement interval (format "date‑time" as specified in 
      Section 5.6 of [RFC3339]; see also "date‑and‑time" in Section 3 of [RFC6991]). 
      The UTC Time Zone is required by Section 6.1 of [RFC2330].

   TotalPkts:
      The count of packets sent by the Src to the Dst during the measurement interval.

   95Percentile:
      The time value of the result is expressed in units of seconds, as a positive value 
      of type decimal64 with fraction digits = 9 (see Section 9.3 of [RFC6020]) with a 
      resolution of 0.000000001 seconds (1.0 ns).

4.4.3. Metric Units

   The 95th percentile of round-trip delay is expressed in seconds.

4.4.4. Calibration

   Section 3.7.3 of [RFC7679] provides a means to quantify the systematic and random errors 
   of a time measurement. Calibration in-situ could be enabled with an internal loopback at 
   the Source host that includes as much of the measurement system as possible, performs address 
   manipulation as needed, and provides some form of isolation (e.g., deterministic delay) to 
   avoid send-receive interface contention. Some portion of the random and systematic error can 
   be characterized in this way.

   When a measurement controller requests a calibration measurement, the loopback is applied and 
   the result is output in the same format as a normal measurement, with an additional indication 
   that it is a calibration result.

   Both internal loopback calibration and clock synchronization can be used to estimate the available 
   accuracy of the Output Metric Units. For example, repeated loopback delay measurements will 
   reveal the portion of the output result resolution that is the result of system noise and is 
   thus inaccurate.
