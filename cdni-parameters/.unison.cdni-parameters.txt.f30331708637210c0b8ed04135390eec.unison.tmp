 Directive names are to be allocated with a format of NAMEFORMAT (see
 Section 3.1 of [RFC7937]). All directive names defined
 in the logging file are case-insensitive as per the basic ABNF
 ([RFC5234]).

 Each specification that defines a new CDNI Logging directive needs to
 contain a description for the new directive with the same set of
 information as provided in Section 3.3 of [RFC7937]
 (i.e., format, directive value and occurrence).

 Record-types are to be allocated with a format of NAMEFORMAT (see

 Each specification that defines a new record-type needs to contain a

 includes:

 o a list of all the CDNI Logging fields that can appear in a CDNI
 Logging Record of the new record-type

 Field in the new record-type

 o for every newly defined Field, i.e., for every Field that results
 in a registration in the CDNI Logging Field Names Registry: a
 specification of the field name, format and field value.
