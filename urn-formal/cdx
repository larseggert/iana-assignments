Purpose:

  CycloneDX is a software bill of materials OWASP standard. CycloneDX
  bill of materials documents (BOMs) are intended to be exchanged
  between different parties of the software supply chain.

  URNs in the "cdx" namespace are used as a means of persistently
  identifying CycloneDX BOMs.

  When creating a BOM, a CycloneDX URN can be used to reference an
  upstream BOM for a component rather than embedding it inline. This may
  be a consideration for performance reasons. Especially in resource
  constrained environments such as embedded devices. It can also be used
  when a software supplier does not have authority to share upstream BOM
  content directly.

  CycloneDX also supports "BOM refs". A BOM ref is a reference to a
  particular element within a BOM. A "cdx" URN with an f-component is a
  BOM ref, with the f-component specifying the location of the element
  within the BOM identified by the URN.

Syntax:

  The syntax for a CycloneDX URN namestring is defined using the
  Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) below. It uses "UUID" as defined in
  [RFC4122] and "f-component" as defined in [RFC3986].

    namestring             = assigned-name [ "#" f-component ]
    assigned-name          = "urn:cdx:" NSS
    NSS                    = bom-serial-number "/" bom-version
    bom-serial-number-uuid = UUID
    bom-version            = nonzero-digit *digit ; an integer >= 1
    nonzero-digit          = %x31-39 ; 1-9

Assignment:

  CycloneDX URNs are assigned in a decentralised way, using the BOM
  serial number. BOM serial numbers are version 4 UUIDs as defined in
  [RFC4122]. Once assigned, BOM serial numbers are unique and
  persistent.

Security and Privacy:

  As CycloneDX URNs are based on UUIDs they have the same security
  considerations as UUID URNs as per [RFC4122].

  Additionally, there are no specification limitations beyond [RFC3986]
  on what can be included in an f-component. Given that f-components may
  be published in CyclineDX URNs, producers of BOMs should avoid using
  any value on which there are sharing restrictions. For producers of
  BOMs who have high confidentiality requirements, it is recommended to
  use UUIDs for f-components.

Interoperability:

  Although CycloneDX BOMs may use a UUID URN to identify a BOM via its
  BOM serial number, the serial number isn’t sufficient when referencing
  a BOM because a particular BOM may be revised over time. Even in the
  case of legacy software that is not conceptualized as changing,
  mistakes and omissions can be corrected over time causing changes in
  the BOM. This is allowed for by successive "cdx" URNs in which the BOM
  serial number is static and the version is incremented.
