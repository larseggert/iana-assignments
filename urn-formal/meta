Background:  

According to ISO 5127, metadata is data about other data, documents or 
records that describes their content, context, structure, data format, 
provenance and/or rights attached to them. Metadata elements and their 
machine readable codes are specified in (cataloguing) formats. 
Libraries have been using a metadata format (Machine Readable 
Cataloguing, MARC) since late 1960s, and starting in 1990s, museums, 
archives and many other organizations have developed their own metadata 
formats. There are also metadata formats for administrative metadata 
(rights, long-term preservation). As a result of this format 
proliferation and increased availability of high-quality structured 
metadata as open linked data, it is important to enable human and 
machine users to make sense of metadata. This requires at least basic 
understanding of metadata elements in these formats, such as Dublin 
Core Title or MARC 21 tag 245, Title statement.      

Metadata format specifications are usually available in the Web for 
free. For instance, the Library of Congress has published MARC 21 
formats at https://www.loc.gov/marc/. The National Library of Finland 
maintains translations of these formats at 
<https://marc21.kansalliskirjasto.fi/>. A list of MARC 21 translations 
(n = 20) is available at <https://www.loc.gov/marc/translations.html>. 
 
From users' point of view, using MARC 21 documentation is not as easy 
as it should be. Information may have been published in a form (e.g. 
a PDF document) which is not sufficiently machine understandable. And 
even if information about each metadata element is available in HTML, 
there are no explicit links between translations. There is no connection 
between the page describing Title statement in English 
<https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/bd245.html>, the page describing 
it in Finnish <https://marc21.kansalliskirjasto.fi/bib/20X-24X.htm#245>
and the Swedish version 
<https://www.kb.se/katalogisering/Formathandboken/Bibliografiska-formatet/210-249/#245>.    

Most metadata format communities have chosen to use location dependent 
HTTP URLs as identifiers for their metadata formats and their elements. 
The only exception is the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative, which chose 
Persistent URLs (PURLs) as identifiers. For instance, DC metadata 
element Creator has two Persistent URLs; 

http://purl.org/dc/terms/creator  

in the /terms/ namespace, and 

http://purl.org/dc/terms/1.1/creator

in the /elements/1.1/ namespace, because these two creators have 
different semantics.

NOTE: These PURLs identify creator-related metadata elements in the 
Dublin Core format, not the creators themselves. Creators have other 
identifiers, such as ORCiDs and ISNIs, which may be expressed as URIs 
(e.g. <http://www.isni.org/isni/0000000124292982>).  

The French translation of DCMI Metadata Terms uses the same PURLs, but 
they resolve to English texts. In order to access French element 
descriptions, it is necessary to use their URLs, such as 
<http://www.yoyodesign.org/doc/dcmi/dcmi-terms/index.html#terms-creator>
or creator in the Terms namespace. Translations to e.g. Czech, Japanese 
and Italian are similar in this respect: the identifier of the element 
is the PURL of the English version (which is OK), but the PURL does not 
enable the user to retrieve documentation about the element in the 
appropriate language. 

From users' point of view it is confusing that in MARC 21 and all other 
formats which rely on HTTP URLs, each translation of the format has its 
own set of identifiers. In Dublin Core the same identifier is used for 
several translations, but the identifier provides linking only to the 
version in English. Therefore users who want to understand the metadata 
they see, may have difficulties finding this information in an 
appropriate language.  

NOTE: Some XML-based metadata formats have XML namespaces: 

AudioMD: http://www.loc.gov/audioMD/
MARCXML: http://www.loc.gov/MARC21/slim
PREMIS: http://www.loc.gov/premis/rdf/v3/
VideoMD: http://www.loc.gov/videoMD/

Unfortunately namespaces for AudioMD, MARCXML and VideoMD are not 
resolvable using e.g. HTTP, and functionality supported by the PREMIS 
namespace is insufficient - links to individual tags such as 

http://www.loc.gov/premis/rdf/v3/Copyright

do not provide useful results, since they all take the client only to 
the beginning of the file containing all element descriptions. When 
implemented in this manner links to descriptions of metadata elements do 
not help human and machine users of metadata to understand the metadata 
provided.


Purpose:

Provide a uniform basis and a tool for identification of elements in 
metadata formats. 

Provide functional improvements to the current URL-based identifiers of 
metadata elements.


Benefits:

Linking to alternative versions (e.g. full / concise, human readable / 
machine readable) of element descriptions with one URN. 
 
Automatic selection of the appropriate language (see below). For 
instance, a bibliographic record containing a link to the URI explaining 
MARC tag 245 in Finnish is only useful for users who understand Finnish, 
because the HTTP server holding these pages cannot redirect Swedish / 
English speaking users to MARC tag 245 pages on other HTTP servers that 
would be appropriate for them. 

Having a URN namespace dedicated for metadata elements may improve 
co-ordination on how identifiers for metadata elements are created and 
what they resolve to. It may also encourage the organizations 
maintaining metadata formats to provide documentation separately for 
each metadata element and in a form more suitable to the Web than e.g. 
PDF. 

A resolution service for URN:META identifiers can direct users to 
information in their preferred languages if the resolution method 
communicates their language preferences to the resolver.   

If a URN:META identifier is assigned to the Library of Congress 
description of MARC 245 tag, it is possible for a resolution service 
to direct a user to the descriptions of this tag in multiple languages, 
depending on the language settings of the user's Web client. This 
functionality can be implemented by supporting the HTTP Accept-Language 
header in the URN resolver. A prerequisite for this functionality is 
that all element URLs from translated versions are harvested to the 
resolver's URN â€“ URL mapping table. Since these URLs should be stable, 
keeping the links up to date is feasible. 

If a network protocol used does not support language negotiation the 
required functionality may also be implemented with the URN R-component.  

NOTE: A URN should not be assigned if an element already has a 
well-managed persistent identifier such as DOI 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier>. 


Syntax:  

The Namespace-Specific String (NSS) consists of three parts:

   o a prefix consisting of a code identifying the metadata format
     and optional sub-namespace code(s) separated by a colon(s); 

   o a hyphen (-) as the delimiting character; and,

   o a string assigned under the auspices of the format maintenance 
     agency. 

These strings may be constructed according to the local preferences as 
long as they are aligned with the requirements of RFC 3986 and RFC 8141.  

Format maintenance agency is the organization maintaining the original 
version of the format, such as Dublin Core Metadata Initiative for 
Dublin Core, or the Library of Congress for MARC 21 formats. A 
maintenance agency shall specify the NSS syntax for its formats, and it 
may outsource the URN assignment and maintenance of URN resolver to a 
third party, such as an organization maintaining a translation of the 
format.   

The following formal definition uses ABNF [RFC5234].

    meta-nss     = prefix "-" meta-string

    prefix      = format-code *( ":" sub-namespace )
                ; The entire prefix is case insensitive.

    format-code  = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT)
                ; As assigned by the National Library of Finland
                ; (identifies the metadata format and the maintenance 
                ; agency to which the branch is delegated). 

    sub-namespace      = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT)
                ; As assigned by the respective format maintenance 
                ; agency.

    meta-string  = path-rootless
                ; The "path-rootless" rule is defined in RFC 3986.
                ; Syntax requirements specified in RFC 8141 MUST be
                ; taken into account.

The meta-string is case-sensitive unless specified as case-insensitive 
by the maintenance agency.

The following metadata format codes SHALL be used:

One code may cover an entire family of formats (e.g. MARC Authority, 
Bibliographic and Holdings formats). Sub-namespaces may be used to 
differentiate formats within these format families if necessary.

Since all prefixes with the same format-code are delegated to the same 
maintenance agency, such families are perforce maintained by the same 
agency.

National translations of metadata standards and cataloguing rules shall 
use the codes and URNs of the original specifications. Thus the Finnish 
translation of MARC 21 shall use the prefix MARC of MARC 21 and URNs 
assigned to the elements of the English version of the format. If 
resolution is done via HTTP, the URN resolver can use HTTP language 
negotiation to direct the client to the correct language version. Other 
network protocols may support similar functionality in the future.  

National variants of metadata formats (e.g. historical FINMARC format, 
which was based on equally outdated USMARC) shall have their own format 
codes, since their tags and semantics may differ from the original ones. 
For instance, UKMARC tag 245 is not the same as USMARC tag 245, since in 
the former subtitle had its own tag, 248, whereas in the latter, 
subtitle was included in tag 245. 

Metadata application profiles such as Darwin Core, an extension of 
Dublin Core intended for sharing of information about biological 
diversity, may have codes of their own if they a) extend the base 
format substantially and b) are well documented and stable.      

The structure (if any) of the meta-string is determined by the authority 
for the prefix. Within the meta-string, it is recommended that a hyphen 
is used for separating different sections of the identifier from one 
another in order to improve the human readability of the string.

Maintenance agencies SHOULD NOT use in meta-strings characters requiring 
percent-encoding. 


Registering format codes: 

New codes will be added by the National Library of Finland on request.  

Requests should be sent to meta-request&helsinki.fi. 

The list of registered format codes will be maintained as a part of this 
document.  

NOTE: Formats included above are the ones most commonly used by 
libraries, archives, museums and in publishing. It is anticipated that 
the need for adding new formats will not be frequent. 


Rules for lexical equivalence:

Whereas the prefix is case insensitive, meta-strings MAY be case 
sensitive at the preference of the assigning authority; parsers 
therefore SHALL treat these as case sensitive, and any case mapping 
needed to introduce case insensitivity is the responsibility of the 
relevant resolution system.

Case insensitivity of the prefix must be taken into account when 
URN:META identifiers are compared.


META assignment:

National and international metadata format maintenance agencies may use 
URN META when they want to assign persistent identifiers for the 
metadata elements and tags of their formats, and provide URN-based 
access to machine or human readable descriptions about these metadata 
elements. For the time being these descriptions are unstructured text 
on Web pages. 

The URN assigned to the element shall not change even if the description 
of the element is changed. URNs assigned to deleted elements shall not 
be re-used.  

Metadata format maintenance agencies shall have procedures in place to 
make sure that the assigned URNs are unique and persistent. Since the 
number of metadata elements on formats is relatively low (at most a few 
hundreds) such procedures can be simple (e.g. URN can be based on the 
name of the element). 


Security and Privacy:

URN:META identifiers do not have any known security or privacy issues. 
They are intended to have publicly-known meanings and do not refer to 
specific individuals, groups, or organizations.


Interoperability:  

URN:META identifiers do not have any known interoperability related 
issues. 


Resolution:  

General

URNs in the URN:META namespace MUST be resolvable. 

Each registrant of a format-code MUST register a base URL (ending in 
"/") for a resolution service for URN:METAs that have that format-code.  
A registrant may provide additional base URLs for prefixes composed of 
that format-code and one or more following sub-namespaces. The base URL 
for resolving a particular URN:META is the base URL for the longest 
registered prefix which is an initial part of the URN's prefix.

A URN:META is resolved by composing a URL by concatenating the base URL 
with the URN:META and fetching that URL using the normal HTTP/HTTPS GET 
method.  The retrieved resource SHOULD describe the identified metadata 
element and MAY provide or reference further information about it.

Resolution services MAY respond to GET requests with a redirection 
response whose Location header field is a URL of a preexisting 
description of the element.  If information about the element is 
available in multiple languages, a resolution service SHOULD use the 
HTTP Accept-Language header to select a URL of a resource in the user's 
requested language.

URN to URL resolution service from the URN to the URL of the page 
describing the identified metadata element MUST be supported. Other 
resolution services such as a link to appropriate cataloguing rule may 
be provided if appropriate.   

Example 1

Namespace URN:META:MARC contains URNs which identify the tags of MARC 
21 metadata formats <https://www.loc.gov/marc/> in various languages. 
Unlike current HTTP URLs, all language versions share the same 
identifier. 

In this example, URNs are expressed as HTTP URIs which use a
(non-existent) URN resolver located http://example.com/. 

It is assumed that the language setting of the client is English (and 
as a default) URNs http://example.com/urn:meta:marc-<meta-string> will 
be resolved at MARC 21 format specific pages at directories  

https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/
https://www.loc.gov/marc/authority/
https://www.loc.gov/marc/holdings/

on the Library of Congress site. 

Case 1 

URN of the MARC Bibliographic format tag 245 (Title Statement)

Assuming that the registered resolver base URL for urn:meta:marc is 
http://example.com/, urn:meta:marc-bd245 would be resolved by fetching

http://example.com/urn:meta:marc-bd245 

which (absent an Accept-Language header in the GET request) would 
redirect either to

https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/bd245.html 
(full description of the tag)

or to 

https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/concise/bd100.html 
(concise description of the tag) 

depending on the service requested. If full description is set as a 
default, concise description can be made available via an R-component 
based service request.   

If the GET request contained "Accept-Language: fi" (preferring 
Finnish), it would always redirect to

https://marc21.kansalliskirjasto.fi/bib/20X-24X.htm#245

since there is only one Finnish translation, based on the concise 
version. 

If the GET request contained "Accept-Language: sv" (preferring Swedish), 
it would always redirect to

http://www.kb.se/katalogisering/Formathandboken/Bibliografiska-formatet/210-249/#245

since there is only one Swedish translation, based on the concise version. 

File names of pages describing tags in MARC 21 formats have the same 
syntax (MARC Bibliographic uses bdxxx.html, where xxx is the tag 
number), no URN â€“ URL mapping table is required in the resolver. Target 
URLs can be generated from URNs programmatically. Since the target URLs 
have been stable for decades, the need to modify programmatic mapping 
should be very infrequent. 

Case 2 

URN of the MARC Authority format tag 100

Assuming that the registered resolver base URL for urn:meta:marc is 
http://example.com/, urn:meta:marc-ad100 would be resolved by fetching

http://example.com/urn:meta:marc-ad100  

which (absent an Accept-Language header in the GET request) would 
redirect to

https://www.loc.gov/marc/authority/ad100.html 

If the request contained "Accept-Language: fi" (preferring Finnish), it 
would redirect to

https://marc21.kansalliskirjasto.fi/aukt/1XX.htm#100 

If the request contained "Accept-Language: sv" (preferring Swedish), it 
would redirect to

http://www.kb.se/katalogisering/Formathandboken/Auktoritetsformatet/1XX/#100

Example 2 

URN of the Dublin Core "terms" namespace property Title and the Dublin 
Core "elements/1.1" namespace element Title.

Assuming that the registered resolver base URL for urn:meta:dc is 
http://example.com/, urn:meta:dc:terms-title would be resolved by 
fetching

http://example.com/urn:meta:dc:terms-title 

which (absent an Accept-Language header in the GET request) would 
redirect to
 
http://purl.org/dc/terms/title

Assuming that the registered resolver base URL for urn:meta:dc is 
http://example.com/, urn:meta:dc:elements1.1-title would be resolved by 
fetching

http://example.com/urn:meta:dc:elements1.1-title 

which (absent an Accept-Language header in the GET request) would 
redirect to
 
http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/title 


Persistence:
 
Persistence of URN:META resolution services depends on the persistence 
of metadata formats. 

Metadata about deprecated MARC formats such as USMARC, UKMARC or 
FINMARC may no longer be available at all, and even if it is, its form 
and content may not be suitable for URN resolution. See for instance 
UKMARC documentation at 

https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20160107133726/http://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/ukmarc.html

or FINMARC documentation at
