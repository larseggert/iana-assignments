Purpose:

The 'stalwart' URN namespace is intended to provide persistent,
location-independent identifiers for resources related to the Stalwart
Mail and Collaboration Server (https://github.com/stalwartlabs/mail-server),
an open-source communication platform. Specifically, this namespace will
be used for:

- Custom JMAP extensions (RFC 8620) that are not covered by existing
  standardized namespaces.
- WebDAV lock tokens (RFC 4918).
- WebDAV synchronization tokens (RFC 6578).

The namespace will benefit the Stalwart Mail and Collaboration Server
user community by providing globally unique, persistent identifiers for
various server resources, enhancing interoperability between server
instances and client applications.

Syntax:

The syntax of the NSS portion of URNs in the 'stalwart' namespace
conforms to the general URN syntax requirements (RFC 8141). The specific
structure is:

urn:stalwart:{resource-type}:{specific-identifier}

where:

- {resource-type} is a string comprised of lowercase letters, digits, and
  hyphens that designates the category of resource being identified. The
  resource-type MUST NOT contain a colon (:) character or any whitespace.
  Currently defined resource-types are "jmap", "davlock", and "davsync".

- {specific-identifier} is the unique identifier for the resource within
  that type, with format dependent on the resource-type as defined below.

Examples:
    - urn:stalwart:jmap:mailfilter
    - urn:stalwart:davlock:a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6
    - urn:stalwart:davsync:a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8

For the currently defined resource-types, the specific-identifier
follows these syntax rules:

    - jmap: A string comprised of lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens,
      describing the extension functionality.

    - davlock: A 128-bit number encoded as 32 hexadecimal digits (using
      characters 0-9 and a-f).

    - davsync: A 64-bit number encoded as 16 hexadecimal digits (using
      characters 0-9 and a-f).

Additional characters allowed by the URN syntax may be used in the
specific-identifier portion for future resource-types that may be
defined, including slashes (/) for hierarchical identifiers.
Percent-encoding is used as needed for characters not allowed in the
URN syntax.

URN-equivalence within this namespace is as defined in RFC 8141, with
the addition that string comparison of the NSS is case-insensitive.

Assignment:

URNs in the 'stalwart' namespace are assigned as follows:

    - Stalwart Labs LLC maintains the registry of all valid
      resource-types, and for each resource-type, the syntax of
      specific-identifiers and the processes by which they may be
      assigned.

    - For JMAP extensions (jmap): Stalwart Labs LLC centrally assigns
      specific-identifiers based on the functionality provided by the
      extension, following a naming convention similar to standard
      JMAP capabilities.

    - For WebDAV lock tokens (davlock): Specific-identifiers are
      algorithmically generated as random 128-bit numbers encoded in
      hexadecimal format by Stalwart server instances. Due to the size
      of the identifier space (2^128) and the random generation method,
      uniqueness is statistically ensured without requiring central
      registration.

    - For WebDAV synchronization tokens (davsync): Specific-identifiers
      are algorithmically generated as 64-bit numbers encoded in
      hexadecimal format by Stalwart server instances. These are
      typically generated based on resource version information with
      techniques that ensure uniqueness within the server context.

Security and Privacy:

The 'stalwart' URN namespace presents no additional security or privacy
considerations beyond those inherent to the use of URNs in general.
However, specific considerations include:

    - WebDAV lock tokens should be treated as private information,
      although they do not grant exclusive access to resources.

    - When WebDAV sync tokens or lock tokens are used across networks,
      they should be transmitted using secure protocols to prevent
      unauthorized interception.

    - JMAP extension identifiers may reveal information about specific
      server capabilities, which could be useful to potential attackers
      in fingerprinting server installations.

Interoperability:

The 'stalwart' URN namespace is designed to avoid conflicts with other
URN namespaces. It complements existing namespaces by providing
identifiers for resources specific to the Stalwart Mail and
Collaboration Server implementation.

For JMAP extensions, this namespace complements the standard JMAP
capabilities URIs, which typically use https://www.ietf.org/rfc/
URIs. The 'stalwart' namespace will be used for non-standardized,
implementation-specific extensions.

For WebDAV functions, this namespace provides an explicit indication
that the lock or sync token originates from a Stalwart server, which
can help in debugging and interoperability across different WebDAV
implementations.

Resolution:

Direct resolution of URNs in the 'stalwart' namespace is not intended.
These URNs serve primarily as identifiers within the context of JMAP
and WebDAV protocols. Resolution to related resources or documentation
may be provided in the future, but no resolution services are specified
at this time.

Documentation:

Documentation for the Stalwart Mail and Collaboration Server, including
information about the 'stalwart' URN namespace, is available at
https://stalw.art/docs/development/urn

Additional Information:

The Stalwart Mail and Collaboration Server is an open-source platform,
and use of the 'stalwart' URN namespace within the scope of projects
related to or derived from this server is permitted according to the
terms of the server's license.
