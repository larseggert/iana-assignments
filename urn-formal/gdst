Purpose:  The purpose of this namespace is to provide businesses and 
traceability solution providers a way to create URNs to be used in the 
GDST 1.0 and GS1 EPCIS standard. The GS1 EPCIS standard allows non-GS1 
URNs to be used. GDST has written an extension standard to the GS1 
EPCIS standard to serve the Seafood industry.

Syntax: There are a number of different linkable data types that need 
to be identified using URNs. There are generic URN pieces for the 
syntax described below, and then for each linkable data type there is 
a specific format as well.
	
There are several different linkable data types in the seafood 
traceability standard that need to be identified. Each format contains 
different syntax pieces that are described here first below:

   [domain / uuid] - The creator of the URN would put their domain 
      that they own here like "example.com" or 
      "traceability-solution.com. If they don't own a domain, they 
      could  optionally populate this section with a UUID. This 
      establishes the organization that is generating the URN.

      The acceptable characters for this are ALPHA, NUMERIC, ".",  
      "-", and "_". No other characters are allowed.

      For URN-equivalence, the [prefix] is not case sensitive.

   [prefix] - This is required on all URNs and establishes the 
      trading party within the organization that is generating the 
      URN. Some organizations will have more than one trading party 
      such as a traceability solution provider who is providing 
      traceability software to one or more trading party.

      The acceptable characters for this are ALPHA, NUMERIC, "-", and 
      "_". No other characters are allowed.

      For URN-equivalence, the [prefix] is not case sensitive.

   [serial] - This is a serial number assigned by the trading party. 
      They will ensure that a serial number cannot be used more than 
      once.

      The acceptable characters for this are ALPHA, NUMERIC, "-", and 
      "_". No other characters are allowed.

      For URN-equivalence, the [serial] is not case sensitive.

   [secondary_id] - This is a secondary ID that can be provided to 
      include further granularity in identifying a data-type that is 
      a child of the [serial]. The term "child" is used loosely here.

      The acceptable characters for this are ALPHA, NUMERIC, "-", and 
      "_". No other characters are allowed.

      For URN-equivalence, the [secondary_id] is not case sensitive.

   Below is a list of each linkable data type and their URN format 
   that they must follow:

   Purchase Order
   Format: urn:gdst:[domain / uuid]:po:[prefix].[serial]
   Example: urn:gdst:example.com:po:12345.PO-04202020_001

Assignment: URN assignment is handled in a semi-decentralized manner. 
Each organization that wishes to assign URNs will establish the 
[domain / uuid] that they will use in their URNs. Within each 
organization, each Trading Party will establish the [prefix] that they 
will use to generate the URNs. Use this pattern, each Trading Party 
will be able to create URNs without colliding with other Trading 
Parties.

Security and Privacy: N/A

Interoperability: No potential issues.

Resolution: No resolution mechanisms.

Documentation: This URN namespace was established based on GDST 1.0 
standard released in March 2020. The GDST 1.0 standard is based on 
EPCIS 1.2 developed by GS1 and the CBV 1.2.2. Links to the 
documentation can be found here below:
