International Organization of Marine Aids to Navigation (IALA)
10 rue des Gaudines, 78100, St Germain en Laye, France

The International Organization of Marine Aids to Navigation (IALA) is a 
leading intergovernmental organization specializing in Marine Aids to 
Navigation. 
Established in 1957, IALA unites Marine Aids to Navigation authorities, 
manufacturers, consultants, and scientific and training institutions 
worldwide. Its mission is to harmonize Marine Aids to Navigation globally, 
ensuring safe, efficient, and cost-effective vessel movements while 
safeguarding the marine environment. On 22 August, 2024, IALA officially 
transitioned from a non-governmental organization (NGO) to an 
intergovernmental organization (IGO).

Purpose:

Many standardized identification schemes exist for vessels, buoys,
mariners and other maritime resources already, but there is no 
single system that allows people to specify such an identifier in 
a uniform and unambiguous way.  We believe that it makes sense to 
introduce a naming scheme that can uniquely identify any maritime 
resource on a global scale.
 
A "maritime resource" can be anything that has an identity, 
including organizations, employees, people, physical objects, 
virtual objects (such as electronic documents), buoys, ships, 
mariners, nautical charts and electronic services (e.g., "today's 
weather report for the Oresund Strait").  Of course, not all 
resources are "retrievable" in an electronic sense; human beings, 
corporations, and buoys would be obvious examples.  However, all 
of these can still be considered resources.

Having a uniform naming scheme will pave the way for new maritime
digital information services, facilitating innovation, integration,
trade, safety, and security in the maritime sector.  

Syntax:

The basic syntax for a MRN is defined using the Augmented 
Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) as specified in [RFC5234]:

MRN= "urn" ":" "mrn" ":" OID ":" OSS
[ rq-components ]
[ "#" f-component ]

OID= (alphanum) 0*20(alphanum / "-") (alphanum) ; 
Organization ID

OSS= OSNID ":" OSNS ; Organization-specific string
 
OSNID = (alphanum) 0*32(alphanum / "-") (alphanum) 
; Organization-specific namespace ID

OSNS  = pchar *(pchar / "/") ; Organization-specific 
namespace string

Rules not defined here:
 
alphanum and pchar as defined in [RFC3986].
 
rq-components and f-component as defined in [RFC8141].
 
The namespace, “mrn”, OID, and OSNID tokens are conventionally 
written in lower case. 

Q-component, F-component and R-component are not generally defined 
by this specification. Organization specific namespace strings 
might choose to make use of them where applicable.

If adopting existing non-URN based identifier systems that 
includes characters not allowed by the URN syntax as specified in 
[RFC8141]. The representation of these characters should be 
handled by percent-encoding the character as specified in Section 
2.1 of the URI specification [RFC3986].

For the efficient use of the namespace, “mrn”, IALA has established a 
guideline G1143 on unique identifiers for maritime resources.

Rules for Lexical Equivalence:

In addition to the URN equivalence rules defined in Section 2.1 of 
the URN specification [RFC8141]. Case normalization must be 
applied to both the OID and OSNID part before determining lexical 
equivalence.

Rules for equality comparisons of the OSNS part must be clearly 
documented by the governing organization, and be consistent with 
sections 3.1 and 6.4.2 of [RFC8141].

Examples:

All the examples provided in this section are hypothetical.
Real world naming schemes will most likely look different.

Using the MRN identifier scheme, a vessel with an IMO number of
9743368 could be identified as follows:

>  urn:mrn:imo:imo-number:9743368

The governing organization that assigns IMO numbers is the
International Maritime Organization (IMO).  IMO may delegate the
actual assignment of numbers to another organization, but it is 
still the organization that determines that an IMO number is 
unique.

Within the context of maritime resource names, the organization ID
(OID) refers to the organization that governs the syntax and rules 
of a particular resource type.  In the example above, the 
organization ID is "imo".

Each organization further divides the organization-specific string
(OSS), which is the part following "imo", into two parts.

The first part is an organization-specific namespace ID (OSNID),
which is a unique identifier within the governing organization for 
a particular type of resource.  In this example, we have used "imo-
number," but this could just as well have been "imonumber" or even 
simply "number".

The second part is the organization-specific namespace string 
(OSNS). This is the only part that differs for resources of the 
same type; in this case it is "9743368".  The 
organization-specific namespace string is, as the name implies, 
specific to a particular combination of OID and OSNID.  In this 
case, the organization-specific namespace string is always a 
7-digit IMO number.

Another way to identify the same vessel might be to use its MMSI
number.  Here the identifier could look like this:

> urn:mrn:itu:mmsi:538070999

In this case ITU is the governing body because MMSI numbers are 
based on ITU recommendation M.585. It is possible that national
bodies might do the actual assignment of MMSI numbers, but ITU is 
the governing body for the standardization of MMSI numbers.

These two examples show how multiple identities can identify the 
same entity; in this case, the same vessel can be identified by 
either an IMO number or MMSI number.  This is similar to how an 
individual might be identified either by a driver license number 
or a social security ID.  Note that some parameters that are 
frequently used for identification, such as human names, do not 
generally qualify as identifiers because they are not guaranteed 
to be unique.  A single identifier must refer to one and only one 
entity.

URNs range from very coarse-grained to very fine-grained.
For example, a container ship might be identified by one of the two
previous URNs.  The containers aboard the ship might be identified
with an URN adapting the ISO 6346 identifier scheme for container
ids.

> urn:mrn:bic:container-id:csqu3054383

Finally, individual items in a single container might be identified
by another URN scheme.  It might even be possible to integrate with
URNs defined outside of the urn:mrn namespace.  For example, all
items in a container might be identified by an electronic product
code ([RFC5134]).  In other words, the use of URNs as identifiers 
is not limited to those defined within this document.  In the 
future, other non-maritime sectors might even adopt similar naming 
schemes based on URNs to facilitate easier integration across 
sector boundaries.

As mentioned earlier, an identifier does not need to be a physical
object; it can be a virtual item such as an electronic document.  
For example, IMO might decide that all of their documents should 
use a "publications" prefix.  The publication "IMO SOLAS 
Consolidated Spanish Edition, 2014 IF110S" might be referred to as:
 
> urn:mrn:imo:publications:if110s
 
On the other hand, an organization such as IALA might decide that
their publications should follow another format where the category 
of the publication is included in the identifier.  For example, a
recommendation could be:

> urn:mrn:iala:publications:recommendation:e-nav-140 

The identifier of a guideline might be written as:

> urn:mrn:iala:publications:guideline:synchronisation-of-lights-1069

As can be seen from the previous example, the organization-specific
namespace string can be split into multiple hierarchies.  The
governing organization can decide how it wants to structure its
identifiers.

Another example of identifiers with multiple hierarchies could be
seen in an identifier scheme for lights and buoys.  Here IALA could
choose to let the OSNS consist of 
<CountryCode>:<National Identifier>. For example:

> urn:mrn:iala:aton:us:1234x5

There are no requirements that organizations be permanent entities.
For example, the European STM Validation Project could choose to 
use "stm" as its organization ID.  A voyage ID in this project 
might look like this:

> urn:mrn:stm:voyage:id:xcus231230 

Within the project, the group may use "xcus231230" to refer to a
voyage plan.  However, the full URN can be used when working with
external systems or other projects, in case another type of
identifier is also used for a particular voyage.

As can be seen from all of these examples, the scheme is highly
adaptable.  Each organization can choose its own layout for a
specific type of identifier.  It is easy to fit existing 
identifiers into the naming scheme, and it provides good context 
information about the type of the identifier, unlike something 
simple such as a random UUID.
  
It is important to note that even though IALA is the maintainer of 
the MRN URN namespace it cannot define MRNs outside of the 
"urn:mrn:iala" namespace. All of the above examples that are not 
in the "urn:mrn:iala" namespace, requires that the relevant 
organization explicitly requests an Organization ID with IALA.

Assignment:
  
Assignment of Organization IDs is done by filling out and sending 
in the registration template, as detailed on 
https://www.iala-aism.org/technical/data-modelling-mrn/. IALA will ensure 
the uniqueness of organization IDs by ensuring that an ID can only be 
assigned once. 
Records of all successful registrations will be maintained in 
a public version control repository as detailed on the website. 

The assignment procedures for MRN strings under a particular 
Organization-specific namespace ID are the responsibility of the 
maintaining organization. The considerations provided by 
https://www.iala-aism.org/technical/data-modelling-mrn/ as well as Section 
6.4.3 of the URN specification [RFC8141] must be taken into account when 
defining the actual assignment procedure.
The detailed procedures are defined in the IALA publication G1164 on the 
Management of Maritime Resource Name Organisation Identifiers.

Security and Privacy:

Around 90% of world trade is carried by the international shipping 
industry and security incidents can result in major disruption to 
world trade or life threatening situations for crew or passengers. 
Since individual organizations manage their own organizational 
namespace, security and privacy must be evaluated on a case by 
case basis.

Interoperability:

Interoperability with existing standards for identifying maritime 
resources is one of the main drivers for this proposal. Since 
individual organizations manage their own organizational 
namespace, interoperability must be evaluated on a case by case 
basis.

Resolution:

No general available resolution mechanisms are anticipated at the 
moment. However, organizations might choose to make use of 
specific resolution mechanisms on a case by case basis.
