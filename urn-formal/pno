Namespace Registration for the PROFIBUS Nutzerorganisation e.V. (PNO)

Namespace Identifier: pno

Version: 1

Date: 2024-05-14

Registrant:

The PROFIBUS Nutzerorganisation e.V. (PNO) is an international 
association that promotes and supports the development of PROFIBUS 
and PROFINET, industrial communication protocols used in automation 
technology.

PNO provides standards, certification programs, and resources to ensure 
product interoperability and reliability, fostering collaboration among 
manufacturers, system integrators, and end-users.

Purpose:

These PNO specified URNs will be part of next editions of e.g., 
"PROFINET" as part of the IEC61158/IEC61784 at the International 
Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).

PROFINET is an industry technical standard for data communication over 
Ethernet, designed for collecting data from, and controlling, equipment 
in industrial systems, with a particular strength in delivering data 
under tight time constraints. It is managed by PNO and is used in 
automation applications, for manufacturing and process automation.

PROFINET is a communication protocol for automation over Ethernet, 
primarily used to network a variety of devices in a production 
environment. Here are the key types of resources that can be described 
and managed using PROFINET:

* Controllers: Often known as Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) 
  or similar devices, PROFINET enables real-time communication between 
  these controllers and connected devices.
* Field Devices: This includes sensors and actuators that provide data 
  or perform physical actions in a production line. Sensors might 
  measure parameters like temperature or pressure, while actuators 
  could be motors, valves, or switches.
* Drive Systems: Components such as frequency converters and servo 
  motors, controlled via PROFINET for precise movement in machines.
* Robot Control: PROFINET facilitates rapid and precise control of 
  robots for assembly or packaging tasks.
* Human Machine Interfaces (HMI): Operator interfaces and visualization 
  systems that allow monitoring and control of processes.
* Safety Devices: Safety-related devices and systems, such as emergency 
  stop switches or safety light barriers, can also be integrated into 
  PROFINET networks, often through specialized protocols like PROFIsafe.
* Network Components: Infrastructure components like switches and 
  routers that manage data transmission over the industrial Ethernet 
  network.

Syntax:

URNs within the "pno" namespace will follow the following structure:

    urn:pno:{PNOresource}:{ResourceSpecificString}

where "PNOresource" is a US-ASCII string that conforms to the URN syntax 
requirements [RFC8141] and defines a specific class of resource type. 
Each resource type has a specific labeling scheme that is covered by 
"ResourceSpecificString", which also conforms to the naming requirements 
[RFC8141].

Assignment:

PNO maintains a registration authority, the PNO Registration Authority 
(PNO CO), that will manage the assignment of "PNOresource", and the 
specific registration values assigned for each resource class.

Security and Privacy:

There are no additional security considerations other than those 
normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general, 
which are described in Functional Requirements for URNs [RFC1737], 
URN Syntax [RFC2141], and URN Namespace Definition Mechanisms [RFC3406].

Interoperability:

There are no known potential issues related to interoperability.

Resolution:

Resolution mechanisms are not intended or anticipated for URNs 
assigned within the URN namespace.

Documentation:

These PNO specified URNs will be part of next editions of e.g., 
"PROFINET" as part of the IEC61158/IEC61784 at the IEC.
