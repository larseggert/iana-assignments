  Note: ENTSO-E is established according to Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 
  and thus could be considered under the "fast-track registration 
  procedure" according to RFC 8141.

Purpose: 

  Electronic data interchange (EDI) in the European energy market 
  requires a common identification scheme to be effective. EIC 
  Participants (traders, producers, qualified consumers, etc.) have 
  the possibility to act in different market areas. System operators 
  need to exchange information amongst themselves as well as with other 
  EIC Participants. In addition, there are many other objects that 
  require identification for information interchange to be successful 
  (tie lines, resource objects, etc.). 

  Furthermore, reference data and data exchanges are adapting semantic 
  web technologies like RDF and SHACL, thus it has been identified that 
  registering EIC as a valid URN would considerably ease the transition 
  process, allowing concrete and concise ways to use those identifiers 
  for rdf:ID, rdf:about, etc., thus being able to comply with semantic 
  web and linked data principles. 

  In order to provide such functionality, a reliable identification 
  scheme is a necessity. The following is a non-exhaustive list of 
  objects that need to be identified: 

  * System operators, traders, producers, consumers, power exchanges, 
    grid operators, suppliers, agents, service providers, etc. 

  * Local grids where metering points are situated, market balance areas 
    consisting of several local grids, control areas, etc. 

  * Cross border connections, metering points, settlement, or accounting 
    points, etc. 

  * Any object that generates or consumes energy. 

  * The physical lines that connect adjacent market (balance) areas or 
    internal lines within an area. 

  * The physical or logical places where an identified object or the IT 
    system of an identified object is or could be located. 

  * Substations for electrical nodes (stations, passive nodes, etc.).
