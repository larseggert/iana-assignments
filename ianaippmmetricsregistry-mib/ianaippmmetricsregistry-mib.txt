   Registration Procedure(s)

 This module has been designated Obsolete. The registry will no longer be updated, and the current contents will be maintained as-is.

   Description

 With the approval and publication of RFC6248, this module is
 designated Obsolete.

 The registry will no longer be updated, and the current contents will
 be maintained as-is on the day that RFC6248 was published.

 The original Description text follows below:

 This module defines a registry for IP Performance Metrics.

 Registrations are done sequentially by IANA in the ianaIppmMetrics
 subtree on the bases of 'Specification Required' as defined in
 [RFC2434].

 The reference of the specification must point to a stable document
 including a title, a revision and a date.

 The name always starts with the name of the organization and must
 respect the SMIv2 rules for descriptors defined in the section 3.1
 of [RFC2578];

 A document that creates new metrics would have an IANA
 considerations section in which it would describe new metrics to
 register.

 An OBJECT IDENTITY assigned to a metric is definitive and cannot
 be reused.  If a new version of a metric is produced then it is
 assigned with a new name and a new identifier.
