           [RFC5795]

   Note

 There appears to be further breakdown:

 In the 8 LSBs, the range 0 to 127 is reserved for IETF standard-track
 specifications; the range 128 to 254 is available for other specifications
 that meet this requirement (such as Informational RFCs). The LSB value 255
 is reserved for future extensibility of the present specification.
