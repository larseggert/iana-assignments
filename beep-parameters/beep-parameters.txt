   Note

 The IANA maintains a registry of standards-track BEEP
 profiles (as specified in Appendix B of RFC 3080).

 To add a BEEP Profile:
 Section 5.1 of RFC 3080 contains a registration template
 that should be completed, approved by the IESG, and then
 placed in this registry.

 As a courtesy to developers of non-standards track BEEP
 profiles, the mailing list beepwg&lists.beepcore.org may be
 used to solicit commentary.

 The IANA maintains a registry of standards-track BEEP

 To add a BEEP Feature:
 Section 5.2 of RFC 3080 contains a registration template
 that should be completed, approved by the IESG, and then
 placed in this registry.
