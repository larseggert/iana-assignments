   Note

 To maximize extensibility while still permitting interoperability, a
 uniform method for encoding message types and bodies is used
 throughout L2TP.  This encoding will be termed AVP (Attribute-Value
 Pair).

         Try another directed. If an LAC or LNS is aware of other possible destinations, it should inform
         the initiator of the control connection or session. The Error Message MUST contain a
         comma-separated list of addresses from which the initiator may choose. If the L2TP data channel
         runs over IPv4, then this would be a comma-separated list of IP addresses in the canonical
     9   dotted-decimal format (e.g., "192.0.2.1, 192.0.2.2, 192.0.2.3") in the UTF-8 charset [RFC3629]
         using the Default Language [RFC2277]. If there are no servers for the LAC or LNS to suggest, then
         Error Code 7 should be used. For IPv4, the delimiter between addresses MUST be precisely a single
         comma and a single space. For IPv6, each literal address MUST be enclosed in "[" and "]"
         characters, following the encoding described in [RFC2732].
