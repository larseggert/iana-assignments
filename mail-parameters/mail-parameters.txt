SMTP Service Extensions

   Registration Procedure(s)

 Standards Action or IESG-Approved Experimental RFC

   Reference
           [RFC5321, Section 2.2]

   Note

 The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol [RFC5321] specifies a set of commands
 or services and a general procedure for extending that set. The table
 below lists SMTP service extensions. Both message submission [RFC6409]
 and mail transfer [RFC5321] may use these extensions unless otherwise
 specified.

 As specified in [RFC5321] Section 2.2.2, no entry may be made in this
 registry that starts in an "X". Entries may be made only for service
 extensions (and associated keywords, parameters, or verbs) that are
 defined in Standards-Track or Experimental RFCs specifically approved
 by the IESG for this purpose.

 The server response to a client EHLO command includes a keyword for
 each service extension the server implements.  Some of these keywords
 have parameters, which are listed in the "SMTP Service Extension
 Parameters" registry.


   Note

 The SMTP Extension names/keywords registered in this section are for
 general use. For those specific to Multicast email, see the registry
 for that protocol below.

   Reference
           [RFC821][RFC822][RFC5321]

   Note

 The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol [RFC821][RFC5321] and the Standard for
 the Format of ARPA Internet Text Messages [RFC822] specify that a set of
 "Received" lines will be prepended to the headers of electronic mail
 messages as they are transported through the Internet.
 These received line may optionally include either or both a "via" phrase
 and/or a "with" phrase.  The legal values for the phrases are listed here.
 The via phrase is intended to indicate the link or physical medium over
 which the message was transferred.  The with phrase is intended to
 indicate the protocol or logical process that was used to transfer the
 message.
