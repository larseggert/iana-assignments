   Note

 These are the official names for character sets that may be used in
 the Internet and may be referred to in Internet documentation.  These
 names are expressed in ANSI_X3.4-1968 which is commonly called
 US-ASCII or simply ASCII.  The character set most commonly use in the
 Internet and used especially in protocol standards is US-ASCII, this
 is strongly encouraged.  The use of the name US-ASCII is also
 encouraged.

 The character set names may be up to 40 characters taken from the
 printable characters of US-ASCII.  However, no distinction is made
 between use of upper and lower case letters.

 The MIBenum value is a unique value for use in MIBs to identify coded
 character sets.

 The value space for MIBenum values has been divided into three
 regions. The first region (3-999) consists of coded character sets
 that have been standardized by some standard setting organization.
 This region is intended for standards that do not have subset
 implementations. The second region (1000-1999) is for the Unicode and
 ISO/IEC 10646 coded character sets together with a specification of a
 (set of) sub-repertoires that may occur.  The third region (>1999) is
 intended for vendor specific coded character sets.

         Assigned MIB enum Numbers
         -------------------------
         0-2             Reserved
         3-999           Set By Standards Organizations

 The aliases that start with "cs" have been added for use with the
 IANA-CHARSET-MIB as originally defined in [RFC3808], and as currently
 maintained by IANA at [IANA registry ianacharset-mib].
 Note that the ianacharset-mib needs to be kept in sync with this
 registry.  These aliases that start with "cs" contain the standard
 numbers along with suggestive names in order to facilitate applications
 that want to display the names in user interfaces.  The "cs" stands
 for character set and is provided for applications that need a lower
 case first letter but want to use mixed case thereafter that cannot
 contain any special characters, such as underbar ("_") and dash ("-").

 If the character set is from an ISO standard, its cs alias is the ISO
 standard number or name.  If the character set is not from an ISO
 standard, but is registered with ISO (IPSJ/ITSCJ is the current ISO
 Registration Authority), the ISO Registry number is specified as
 ISOnnn followed by letters suggestive of the name or standards number
 of the code set.  When a national or international standard is
 revised, the year of revision is added to the cs alias of the new
 character set entry in the IANA Registry in order to distinguish the
 revised character set from the original character set.
