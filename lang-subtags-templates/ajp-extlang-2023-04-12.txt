This registration corrects an error made on 2023-03-17 to the
registration of extended language subtag 'ajp'. In deprecating the
subtag, the Preferred-Value was changed from 'ajp' to 'apc'. According
to RFC 5646, Section 2.2.2, item 3, "Extended language subtag records
MUST include a 'Preferred-Value'. The 'Preferred-Value' and 'Subtag'
fields MUST be identical." This registration restores the Preferred-
Value to 'ajp' for the extended language subtag. The primary language
subtag for 'ajp' continues to have a Preferred-Value of 'apc'.
