Type: variant
Subtag: saigon
Description: The Sài Gòn variant of Vietnamese
Prefix: vi

4. Intended meaning of the subtag:

vi-saigon indicates the Sài Gòn variant of Vietnamese.

5. Reference to published description of the language (book or article):

"Statistical Analysis of Vietnamese Dialect Corpus and Dialect
Identification Experiments" by Pham Ngoc Hung, Trinh Van Loan and Nguyen
Hong Quang (https://ijseas.com/volume2/v2i8/ijseas20160825.pdf). In this
paper, the three main variants (called dialects in the paper) are
discussed: Hà Nội, Huế and Hồ Chí Minh City.

6. Any other relevant information:

The third variant is called Hồ Chí Minh City in the paper. Hồ Chí Minh
City is the current name of the city formerly called Sài Gòn. The third
dialect is well known among Vietnamese people as Sài Gòn, and has been
in use long before the new name Hồ Chí Minh city. In other words, Sài
Gòn as a variant predates Hồ Chí Minh City. Therefore, this request
proposes a subtag named Sài Gòn instead of Hồ Chí Minh City.
