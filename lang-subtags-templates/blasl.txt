(“Black American Sign Language (BASL) or Black Sign Variation (BSV)
is a dialect of American Sign Language (ASL)[1]”).  It seems to be
different enough to call for signaling:

Linguistically, BASL differs from other varieties of ASL in its
phonology, syntax, and vocabulary. BASL tends to have a larger signing
space, meaning that some signs are produced further away from the body
than in other dialects. (Wikipedia)
