This registration adds the Description field "Sercquiais" to the primary

on the island of Sark in the Channel Islands.

ISO 639-3, which added code element [nrf] in 2015, lists "Jèrriais" as
the reference name and "Guernésiais" as an additional name; these
varieties are spoken on the islands of Jersey and Guernsey respectively.
