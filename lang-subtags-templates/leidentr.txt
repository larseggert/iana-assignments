6. Any other relevant information:

In Egyptology, Egyptian lexemes are primarily referred to not by a
hieroglyphic spelling (egy-Egyp) but by a largely Latin-based
Egyptological transliteration (egy-Latn?), which roughly represents the
phonology. Egyptological transcription characters are largely based on
Latin characters with some additions (e.g., ḥ, ṯ, ḏ, ...) and three
Egyptology-specific characters (ꜣ, ꜥ, ꞽ). However, there are many
different transcription systems in the field (cf.
https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Egyptian_transliteration_schemes).
On the occasion of the International Congress of Egyptologist 2023 in
Leiden, an Egyptological working group defined one specific
transcription scheme/version as recommended notably for digital data,
the "Leiden Unified Transliteration/Transcription". We would like this
recommended standard to be referred to by the language tag
"egy-leidentr" (or "egy-Latn-leidentr").
