                                                           The server forbids duplicates, and the record already

   invalidArguments                common       IETF       One of the arguments is of the wrong type or otherwise [RFC8620, Section 3.6.2]
                                                           invalid, or a required argument is missing.

   requestTooLarge                 common       IETF       the server is willing to process in a single method    [RFC8620, Section 5.1 and 5.3]

                                                           An unexpected or unknown error occurred during the

                                                           (perhaps after a backoff with a random factor) may

   singleton                       common       IETF       This is a singleton type, so you cannot create another [RFC8620, Section 5.3]

   stateMismatch                   common       IETF       An ifInState argument was supplied, and it does not    [RFC8620, Section 5.3]
                                                           match the current state.
                                                           The action would result in an object that exceeds a
   tooLarge                        common       IETF       server-defined limit for the maximum size of a single  [RFC8620, Section 5.3]
                                                           object of this type.
   tooManyChanges                  common       IETF       There are more changes than the client's maxChanges    [RFC8620, Section 5.6]

   unsupportedFilter               common       IETF       The filter is syntactically valid, but the server      [RFC8620, Section 5.5]
                                                           cannot process it.
                                                           The sort is syntactically valid but includes a

                                                           The client requested an object be both updated and
   willDestroy                     common       IETF       destroyed in the same /set request, and the server has [RFC8620, Section 5.3]
                                                           decided to therefore ignore the update.
                                                           The Mailbox still has at least one child Mailbox. The
   mailboxHasChild                 common       IETF       client MUST remove these before it can delete the      [RFC8621, Section 2.5]

   mailboxHasEmail                 common       IETF       The Mailbox has at least one message assigned to it,   [RFC8621, Section 2.5]
                                                           and the onDestroyRemoveEmails argument was false.
   blobNotFound                    common       IETF       At least one blob id referenced in the object doesn't  [RFC8621, Section 4.6]

   tooManyKeywords                 common       IETF       The change to the Email's keywords would exceed a      [RFC8621, Section 4.6]
                                                           server-defined maximum.
   tooManyMailboxes                common       IETF       The change to the set of Mailboxes that this Email is  [RFC8621, Section 4.6]
                                                           in would exceed a server-defined maximum.
   invalidEmail                    common       IETF       The Email to be sent is invalid in some way.           [RFC8621, Section 7.5]
