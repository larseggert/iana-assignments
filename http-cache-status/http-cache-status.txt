      Name         Type                                                       Description                                                 Reference
   hit        Boolean         When true, indicates that the request was satisfied by the cache; that is, it was not forwarded, and the    [RFC9211]
                              response was obtained from the cache.
   fwd        Token           When present, indicates that the request went forward towards the origin; its value indicates why.          [RFC9211]
   fwd-status Integer         Indicates which status code (see [RFC9110], Section 15) the next-hop server returned in response to the     [RFC9211]
                              forwarded request.
                              Indicates the response’s remaining freshness lifetime (see [RFC9111], Section 4.2.1) as calculated by the
   ttl        Integer         cache, as an integer number of seconds, measured as closely as possible to when the response header section [RFC9211]
                              is sent by the cache.
   stored     Boolean         Indicates whether the cache stored the response (see [RFC9111], Section 3); a true value indicates that it  [RFC9211]
                              did.
   collapsed  Boolean         Indicates whether this request was collapsed together with one or more other forward requests (see          [RFC9211]
                              [RFC9111], Section 4); If true, the response was successfully reused; if not, a new request had to be made.
   key        String          Conveys a representation of the cache key (see [RFC9111], Section 2) used for the response.                 [RFC9211]
   detail     String or Token Allows implementations to convey additional information not captured in other parameters, such as           [RFC9211]
                              implementation-specific states or other caching-related metrics.
