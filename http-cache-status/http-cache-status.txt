   hit        Boolean         When true, indicates that the request was satisfied by the cache; that is, it was  [RFC-ietf-httpbis-cache-header-10]
                              not forwarded, and the response was obtained from the cache.
   fwd        Token           When present, indicates that the request went forward towards the origin; its      [RFC-ietf-httpbis-cache-header-10]
                              value indicates why.
   fwd-status Integer         Indicates which status code (see [draft-ietf-httpbis-semantics-17], Section 15)    [RFC-ietf-httpbis-cache-header-10]
                              the next-hop server returned in response to the forwarded request.
                              Indicates the response’s remaining freshness lifetime (see
   ttl        Integer         [draft-ietf-httpbis-cache-17], Section 4.2.1) as calculated by the cache, as an    [RFC-ietf-httpbis-cache-header-10]
                              integer number of seconds, measured as closely as possible to when the response

   stored     Boolean         Indicates whether the cache stored the response (see                               [RFC-ietf-httpbis-cache-header-10]
                              [draft-ietf-httpbis-cache-17], Section 3); a true value indicates that it did.

                              response was successfully reused; if not, a new request had to be made.
   key        String          Conveys a representation of the cache key (see [draft-ietf-httpbis-cache-17],      [RFC-ietf-httpbis-cache-header-10]
