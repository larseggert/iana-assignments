   hit        The request was satisfied by the cache; i.e., it was not forwarded, and the response was obtained  [RFC-ietf-httpbis-cache-header-10]
              from the cache.
   fwd        The request went forward towards the origin, and why.                                              [RFC-ietf-httpbis-cache-header-10]
   fwd-status The status code (see [draft-ietf-httpbis-semantics-17], Section 15) the next hop server returned   [RFC-ietf-httpbis-cache-header-10]
              in response to the forwarded request.
              The response's remaining freshness lifetime (see [draft-ietf-httpbis-cache-17], Section 4.2.1) as
   ttl        calculated by the cache, as an integer number of seconds, measured as closely as possible to when  [RFC-ietf-httpbis-cache-header-10]
              the response header section is sent by the cache.
   stored     The cache stored the response (see [draft-ietf-httpbis-cache-17], Section 3); a true value         [RFC-ietf-httpbis-cache-header-10]
              indicates that it did.
              This request was collapsed together with one or more other forward requests (see
   collapsed  [draft-ietf-httpbis-cache-17], Section 4); if true, the response was successfully reused; if not,  [RFC-ietf-httpbis-cache-header-10]
              a new request had to be made.
