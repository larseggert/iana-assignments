NTP Extension Field Types

   Registration Procedure(s)

 Specification Required

   Expert(s)

 Unassigned

   Reference
   [RFC5905][RFC5906][RFC9748]

   Note

 Field Types in the range 0xF000 through 0xFFFF, inclusive, are reserved
 for experimentation and development. IANA cannot assign them. Both NTS
 Cookie and Autokey Message Request have the same Field Type; in practice
 this is not a problem as the field semantics will be determined by other
 parts of the message.


   Note

 The "Reserved for historic reasons" is for differences between the
 original documentation and implementation of Autokey and marks the
 erroneous values as reserved, in case there is an implementation that
 used the registered values instead of what the original implementation
 used.
