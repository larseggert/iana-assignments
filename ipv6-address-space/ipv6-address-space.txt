   Note

 The IPv6 address management function was formally delegated to IANA
 in December 1995 [RFC1881]. The registration procedure was confirmed
 with the IETF Chair in March 2010.

 As stated in [RFC3513], IANA should limit its allocation of
 IPv6-unicast address space to the range of addresses that start with
 binary value 001. The rest of the global unicast address space
 (approximately 85% of the IPv6 address space) is reserved for future
 definition and use, and is not to be assigned by IANA at this time.

 While [RFC3513] was obsoleted by [RFC4291], the guidance provided to
 IANA did not change regarding the allocation of IPv6 unicast
 addresses.
