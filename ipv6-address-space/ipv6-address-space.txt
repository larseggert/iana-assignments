   Note

 The IPv6 address management function was formally delegated to IANA
 in December 1995 [RFC1881]. The registration procedure was confirmed
 with the IETF Chair in March 2010.

 As stated in [RFC3513], IANA should limit its allocation of
 IPv6-unicast address space to the range of addresses that start with
 binary value 001. The rest of the global unicast address space
 (approximately 85% of the IPv6 address space) is reserved for future
 definition and use, and is not to be assigned by IANA at this time.

 While [RFC3513] was obsoleted by [RFC4291], the guidance provided to
 IANA did not change regarding the allocation of IPv6 unicast
 addresses.

                                                       This range has been partially allocated. See [IANA registry iana-ipv6-special-registry] for
   ::/8        Reserved by IETF     [RFC3513][RFC4291] details. ::/96, formerly defined as the "IPv4-compatible IPv6 address" prefix, was
                                                       deprecated by [RFC4291].
   100::/8     Reserved by IETF     [RFC3513][RFC4291] This range has been partially allocated. See [IANA registry iana-ipv6-special-registry] for

   200::/7     Reserved by IETF     [RFC4048]          Deprecated as of December 2004 [RFC4048]. Formerly an OSI NSAP-mapped prefix set [RFC4548].

                                                       The IPv6 Unicast space encompasses the entire IPv6 address range with the exception of
   2000::/3    Global Unicast       [RFC3513][RFC4291] ff00::/8, per [RFC4291]. IANA unicast address assignments are currently limited to the IPv6
                                                       unicast address range of 2000::/3. IANA assignments from this block are registered in [IANA
                                                       registry ipv6-unicast-address-assignments].
                                                       This range has been partially allocated. See [IANA registry iana-ipv6-special-registry] for
   4000::/3    Reserved by IETF     [RFC3513][RFC4291] details. 5f00::/8 (with 3ffe::/16, as noted at [IANA registry
                                                       ipv6-unicast-address-assignments]) was used for the 6bone, but returned [RFC5156].
