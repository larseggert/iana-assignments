                      This authentication extension allows WebAuthn        [Web Authentication]
   appid              Relying Parties that have previously registered a    Section §10.1, FIDO AppID   [W3C_Web_Authentication_Working_Group]

                      This registration extension and authentication       [Web Authentication]
                      extension allows for a simple form of transaction    Section §10.2, Simple
   txAuthSimple       authorization. A WebAuthn Relying Party can specify  Transaction Authorization   [W3C_Web_Authentication_Working_Group]
                      a prompt string, intended for display on a trusted   Extension (txAuthSimple)
                      device on the authenticator
                      This registration extension and authentication
                      extension allows images to be used as transaction    [Web Authentication]
                      authorization prompts as well. This allows           Section §10.3, Generic
   txAuthGeneric      authenticators without a font rendering engine to be Transaction Authorization   [W3C_Web_Authentication_Working_Group]
                      used and also supports a richer visual appearance    Extension (txAuthGeneric)
                      than accomplished with the webauthn.txauth.simple
                      extension.
                      This registration extension allows a WebAuthn
                      Relying Party to guide the selection of the          [Web Authentication]
   authnSel           authenticator that will be leveraged when creating   Section §10.4,              [W3C_Web_Authentication_Working_Group]
                      the credential. It is intended primarily for         Authenticator Selection

                      control the experience around credential creation.
                      This registration extension enables the WebAuthn
                      Relying Party to determine which extensions the
                      authenticator supports. The extension data is a list [Web Authentication]
   exts               (CBOR array) of extension identifiers encoded as     Section §10.5, Supported    [W3C_Web_Authentication_Working_Group]
                      UTF-8 Strings. This extension is added automatically Extensions Extension (exts)
                      by the authenticator. This extension can be added to
                      attestation statements.
                      This registration extension and authentication
                      extension enables use of a user verification index.
                      The user verification index is a value uniquely      [Web Authentication]
                      identifying a user verification data record. The UVI Section §10.6, User
   uvi                data can be used by servers to understand whether an Verification Index          [W3C_Web_Authentication_Working_Group]
                      authentication was authorized by the exact same      Extension (uvi)
                      biometric data as the initial key generation. This
                      allows the detection and prevention of "friendly
                      fraud".
                      The location registration extension and
                      authentication extension provides the client         [Web Authentication]

                      Party, if supported by the client platform and       Extension (loc)
                      subject to user consent.
                      This registration extension and authentication
                      extension enables use of a user verification method. [Web Authentication]
