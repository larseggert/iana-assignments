                      This authentication extension allows WebAuthn Relying  [Web Authentication]
   appid              Parties that have previously registered a credential   Section §10.1, FIDO AppID [W3C_Web_Authentication_Working_Group]
                      using the legacy FIDO JavaScript APIs to request an    Extension (appid)
                      assertion.
                      This registration extension and authentication         [Web Authentication]
                      extension allows for a simple form of transaction      Section §10.2, Simple
   txAuthSimple       authorization. A WebAuthn Relying Party can specify a  Transaction Authorization [W3C_Web_Authentication_Working_Group]
                      prompt string, intended for display on a trusted       Extension (txAuthSimple)
                      device on the authenticator
                      This registration extension and authentication
                      extension allows images to be used as transaction      [Web Authentication]
                      authorization prompts as well. This allows             Section §10.3, Generic
   txAuthGeneric      authenticators without a font rendering engine to be   Transaction Authorization [W3C_Web_Authentication_Working_Group]
                      used and also supports a richer visual appearance than Extension (txAuthGeneric)
                      accomplished with the webauthn.txauth.simple
                      extension.
                      This registration extension allows a WebAuthn Relying
                      Party to guide the selection of the authenticator that [Web Authentication]
   authnSel           will be leveraged when creating the credential. It is  Section §10.4,            [W3C_Web_Authentication_Working_Group]
                      intended primarily for WebAuthn Relying Parties that   Authenticator Selection
                      wish to tightly control the experience around          Extension (authnSel)
                      credential creation.
                      This registration extension enables the WebAuthn
                      Relying Party to determine which extensions the        [Web Authentication]
                      authenticator supports. The extension data is a list   Section §10.5, Supported
   exts               (CBOR array) of extension identifiers encoded as UTF-8 Extensions Extension      [W3C_Web_Authentication_Working_Group]
                      Strings. This extension is added automatically by the  (exts)
                      authenticator. This extension can be added to
                      attestation statements.
                      This registration extension and authentication
                      extension enables use of a user verification index.
                      The user verification index is a value uniquely        [Web Authentication]
                      identifying a user verification data record. The UVI   Section §10.6, User
   uvi                data can be used by servers to understand whether an   Verification Index        [W3C_Web_Authentication_Working_Group]
                      authentication was authorized by the exact same        Extension (uvi)
                      biometric data as the initial key generation. This
                      allows the detection and prevention of "friendly
                      fraud".
                      The location registration extension and authentication [Web Authentication]
   loc                extension provides the client device's current         Section §10.7, Location   [W3C_Web_Authentication_Working_Group]
                      location to the WebAuthn Relying Party, if supported   Extension (loc)
                      by the client platform and subject to user consent.
                      This registration extension and authentication         [Web Authentication]
                      extension enables use of a user verification method.   Section §10.3, User
   uvm                The user verification method extension returns to the  Verification Method       [W3C_Web_Authentication_Working_Group]
                      WebAuthn Relying Party which user verification methods Extension (uvm)
                      (factors) were used for the WebAuthn operation.
                      This registration extension allows relying parties to
                      specify a credential protection policy when creating a [Client to Authenticator
   credProtect        credential. Additionally, authenticators may choose to Protocol (CTAP)] Section  [W3C_Web_Authentication_Working_Group]
                      establish a default credential protection policy       §12.1 Credential
                      greater than userVerificationOptional (the lowest      Protection (credProtect)
                      level) and unilaterally enforce such policy.
                      This registration extension and authentication         [Client to Authenticator
                      extension enables RPs to provide a small amount of     Protocol (CTAP)] Section
   credBlob           extra credential configuration information (the        §12.2 Credential Blob     [W3C_Web_Authentication_Working_Group]
                      credBlob value) to the authenticator when a credential (credBlob)
                      is made.
                      This client platform-only extension provides for       [Client to Authenticator
   largeBlobKey       storage and retrieval of a per-credential key that is  Protocol (CTAP)] Section  [W3C_Web_Authentication_Working_Group]
                      used by the client platform when writing and reading   §12.3 Large Blob Key

                      This registration extension and authentication         [Client to Authenticator
