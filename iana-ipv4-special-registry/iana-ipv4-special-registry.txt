IANA IPv4 Special-Purpose Address Registry

   Registration Procedure(s)

 IETF Review

   Reference
           [RFC5736][RFC6890][RFC Errata 6404][RFC8190]

   Note

 The IETF has reserved the address block of 192.0.0.0/24 for use for
 special purposes relating to protocol assignments. This registry
 contains the current assignments made by the IETF from this address
 block.

 Address prefixes listed in the Special-Purpose Address Registry are
 not guaranteed routability in any particular local or global context.

 The IPv4 and IPv6 Special-Purpose Address Registries maintain the
 following information regarding each entry:

    o  Address Block - A block of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses that has been
       registered for a special purpose.

    o  Name - A descriptive name for the special-purpose address block.

    o  RFC - The RFC through which the special-purpose address block was
       requested.

    o  Allocation Date - The date upon which the special-purpose address
       block was allocated.

    o  Termination Date - The date upon which the allocation is to be
       terminated.  This field is applicable for limited-use allocations
       only.

    o  Source - A boolean value indicating whether an address from the
       allocated special-purpose address block is valid when used as the
       source address of an IP datagram that transits two devices.

    o  Destination - A boolean value indicating whether an address from
       the allocated special-purpose address block is valid when used as
       the destination address of an IP datagram that transits two
       devices.

    o  Forwardable - A boolean value indicating whether a router may
       forward an IP datagram whose destination address is drawn from the
       allocated special-purpose address block between external
       interfaces.

    o  Globally Reachable - A boolean value indicating whether an IP
       datagram whose destination address is drawn from the allocated
       special-purpose address block is forwardable beyond a specified
       administrative domain.

    o  Reserved-by-Protocol - A boolean value indicating whether the
       special-purpose address block is reserved by IP, itself.  This
       value is "TRUE" if the RFC that created the special-purpose
       address block requires all compliant IP implementations to behave
       in a special way when processing packets either to or from
       addresses contained by the address block.

    If the value of "Destination" is FALSE, the values of "Forwardable"
    and "Globally Reachable" must also be false.
