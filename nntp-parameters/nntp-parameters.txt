NNTP Capability Labels

   Registration Procedure(s)

 Labels beginning with X are reserved for private use.
 All others: Standards Track RFC or an IESG-approved experimental protocol.

   Reference
           [RFC3977]

   Note

 All capability labels in the registry MUST consist only of US-ASCII
 letters, digits, and the characters dot (".") and dash ("-"), and
 MUST begin with a letter other than X.  They MUST be at least
 three characters.
