   0     Reserved                                                                                                                         [RFC9711]
   1     Generic attestation describes an application where the EAT consumer requires the most up-to-date security assessment of the      [RFC9711]
         attesting entity. It is expected that this is the most commonly-used application of EAT.
   2     Entities that are registering for a new service may be expected to provide an attestation as part of the registration process.   [RFC9711]
         This "intuse" setting indicates that the attestation is not intended for any use but registration.
   3     Entities may be provisioned with different values or settings by an EAT consumer. Examples include key material or device        [RFC9711]
         management trees. The consumer may require an EAT to assess entity security state of the entity prior to provisioning.
         Certification Authorities (CAs) may require attestation results (which in a background check model might require receiving
   4     evidence to be passed to a verifier) to make decisions about the issuance of certificates. An EAT may be used as part of the     [RFC9711]
         certificate signing request (CSR).
         An EAT consumer may require an attestation as part of an accompanying proof-of-possession (PoP) application. More precisely, a
   5     PoP transaction is intended to provide to the recipient cryptographically-verifiable proof that the sender has possession of a   [RFC9711]
         key. This kind of attestation may be necessary to verify the security state of the entity storing the private key used in a PoP
         application.
