   1     Generic attestation describes an application where the EAT consumer requires the most up-to-date security           [RFC-ietf-rats-eat-29]
         assessment of the attesting entity. It is expected that this is the most commonly-used application of EAT.
         Entities that are registering for a new service may be expected to provide an attestation as part of the
   2     registration process. This "intuse" setting indicates that the attestation is not intended for any use but          [RFC-ietf-rats-eat-29]
         registration.
         Entities may be provisioned with different values or settings by an EAT consumer. Examples include key material or
   3     device management trees. The consumer may require an EAT to assess entity security state of the entity prior to     [RFC-ietf-rats-eat-29]
         provisioning.
         Certification Authorities (CAs) may require attestation results (which in a background check model might require
   4     receiving evidence to be passed to a verifier) to make decisions about the issuance of certificates. An EAT may be  [RFC-ietf-rats-eat-29]
         used as part of the certificate signing request (CSR).
         An EAT consumer may require an attestation as part of an accompanying proof-of-possession (PoP) application. More
   5     precisely, a PoP transaction is intended to provide to the recipient cryptographically-verifiable proof that the    [RFC-ietf-rats-eat-29]
         sender has possession of a key. This kind of attestation may be necessary to verify the security state of the
         entity storing the private key used in a PoP application.
