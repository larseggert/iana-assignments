   Description

 This MIB module defines IANAgBondScheme and IANAgBondSchemeList
     TEXTUAL-CONVENTIONs, specifying enumerated values of the
     gBondPortConfAdminScheme, gBondPortConfPeerAdminScheme,
     gBondPortStatOperScheme, gBondPortStatPeerOperScheme,
     gBondPortCapSchemesSupported, and gBondPortCapPeerSchemesSupported
     objects, respectively, as defined in the GBOND-MIB.

     It is intended that each new bonding scheme defined by the
     ITU-T Q4/SG15 working group and approved for publication in a
     revision of the ITU-T G.998 specification will be added to this
     MIB module, provided that it is suitable for being managed by the
     base objects in the GBOND-MIB.  An Expert Review, as defined in
     [RFC8126], is REQUIRED for such additions.

     The following references are used throughout this MIB module:

     [G.998.1] refers to:
     ITU-T Recommendation G.998.1: 'ATM-based multi-pair bonding',
     January 2005.

     [G.998.2] refers to:
     ITU-T Recommendation G.998.2: 'Ethernet-based multi-pair
     bonding', January 2005.

     [G.998.3] refers to:
     ITU-T Recommendation G.998.3: 'Multi-pair bonding using
     time-division inverse multiplexing', January 2005.

     Naming Conventions:
     BCE   - Bonding Channel Entity
     GBS   - Generic Bonding Sub-layer

     These references should be updated as appropriate when a new
     bonding scheme is added to this MIB module.
