Signature Algorithms

 Unassigned

   Reference
           [RFC-ietf-trans-rfc6962-bis-42]

   Note

 This is a subset of the TLS SignatureScheme Registry, limited to
 those algorithms that are appropriate for CT.  A major advantage
 of this is leveraging the expertise of the TLS working group and
 its Designated Expert(s).


   Note

 The value "0x0403" appears twice.  While this may be confusing, it
 is okay because the verification process is the same for both
 algorithms, and the choice of which to use when generating a
 signature is purely internal to the log server.

 The range 0x0000-0x00FF is reserved so that v1 SCTs are distinguishable
 from v2 SCTs and other TransItem structures.

   Note

 All OIDs in the range from 1.3.101.8192 to 1.3.101.16383 have been
 set aside for Log IDs.  This is a limited resource of 8,192 OIDs,
 each of which has an encoded length of 4 octets.


   Note

 The 1.3.101.80 arc has also been set aside for Log IDs.  This is an
 unlimited resource, but only the 128 OIDs from 1.3.101.80.0 to
 1.3.101.80.127 have an encoded length of only 4 octets.
