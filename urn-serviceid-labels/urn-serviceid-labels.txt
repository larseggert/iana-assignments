   Note

 The policy for adding top-level service labels is 'Standards Action'.
 The policy for assigning labels to sub-services may differ for
 each top-level service designation and MUST be defined by the document
 describing the top-level service.

 To allow use within the constraints of S-NAPTR [ref], all top-level
 service names MUST NOT exceed 27 characters.
