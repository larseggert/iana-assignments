   Last Updated

   Registration Procedure(s)

 Allocations to RIRs are made in line with the Global Policy published at
 [http://www.icann.org/en/resources/policy/global-addressing].
 All other assignments require IETF Review.

   Description

 The allocation of Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) unicast address space is listed
 here. References to the various other registries detailing the use of the IPv6 address
 space can be found in the [IPv6 Address Space registry].

   Reference
   [RFC7249]

   Note

 The assignable Global Unicast Address space is defined in [RFC3513] as the address block
 defined by the prefix 2000::/3. [RFC3513] was later obsoleted by [RFC4291]. All address
 space in this block not listed in the table below is reserved by IANA for future
 allocation.
