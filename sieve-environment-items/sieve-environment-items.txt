                                    If the script was invoked because of flag changes to an existing

   imap.cause                       value is one of the following: APPEND (for invocations resulting from [RFC6785]  [The_Sieve_discussion_list]
                                    APPEND commands), COPY (for invocations resulting from COPY

   imap.mailbox                     of new messages. The value of this item is fixed when the script      [RFC6785]  [The_Sieve_discussion_list]
                                    begins, and, in particular, MUST NOT change as a result of any
