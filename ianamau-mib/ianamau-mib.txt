   Description

 This MIB module defines dot3MauType OBJECT-IDENTITIES and
 IANAifMauListBits, IANAifMauMediaAvailable,
 IANAifMauAutoNegCapBits, and IANAifJackType

 TEXTUAL-CONVENTIONs, specifying enumerated values of the
 ifMauTypeListBits, ifMauMediaAvailable / rpMauMediaAvailable,
 ifMauAutoNegCapabilityBits / ifMauAutoNegCapAdvertisedBits /
 ifMauAutoNegCapReceivedBits and ifJackType / rpJackType objects
 respectively, defined in the MAU-MIB.

 It is intended that each new MAU type, Media Availability
 state, Auto Negotiation capability and/or Jack type defined by
 the IEEE 802.3 working group and approved for publication in a
 revision of IEEE Std 802.3 will be added to this MIB module,
 provided that it is suitable for being managed by the base
 objects in the MAU-MIB.  An Expert Review, as defined in
 RFC 2434 [RFC2434], is REQUIRED for such additions.

 The following reference is used throughout this MIB module:

 [IEEE802.3] refers to IEEE Std 802.3, 2018 Edition:
 'IEEE Standard for Ethernet'.

 This reference should be updated as appropriate when new
 MAU types, Media Availability states, Auto Negotiation
 capabilities, and/or Jack types are added to this MIB module.
