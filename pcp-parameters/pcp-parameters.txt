   1       UNSUPP_VERSION               The version number at the start of the PCP Request header is not recognized by this PCP server.   [RFC6887]
                                        This is a long lifetime error. [RFC6887] describes PCP version 2.
   2       NOT_AUTHORIZED               The requested operation is disabled for this PCP client, or the PCP client requested an operation [RFC6887]
                                        that cannot be fulfilled by the PCP server's security policy. This is a long lifetime error.
   3       MALFORMED_REQUEST            The request could not be successfully parsed. This is a long lifetime error.                      [RFC6887]
   4       UNSUPP_OPCODE                Unsupported Opcode. This is a long lifetime error.                                                [RFC6887]
   5       UNSUPP_OPTION                Unsupported Option. This error only occurs if the Option is in the mandatory-to-process range.    [RFC6887]
                                        This is a long lifetime error.
   6       MALFORMED_OPTION             Malformed Option (e.g., appears too many times, invalid length). This is a long lifetime error.   [RFC6887]
   7       NETWORK_FAILURE              The PCP server or the device it controls are experiencing a network failure of some sort (e.g.,   [RFC6887]
                                        has not obtained an External IP address). This is a short lifetime error.
                                        Request is well-formed and valid, but the server has insufficient resources to complete the
                                        requested operation at this time. For example, the NAT device cannot create more mappings at this
   8       NO_RESOURCES                 time, is short of CPU cycles or memory, or is unable to handle the request due to some other      [RFC6887]
                                        temporary condition. The same request may succeed in the future. This is a system-wide error,
                                        different from USER_EX_QUOTA. This can be used as a catch- all error, should no other error
                                        message be suitable. This is a short lifetime error.
   9       UNSUPP_PROTOCOL              Unsupported transport protocol, e.g. SCTP in a NAT that handles only UDP and TCP. This is a long  [RFC6887]
                                        lifetime error.
   10      USER_EX_QUOTA                This attempt to create a new mapping would exceed this subscriber's port quota. This is a short   [RFC6887]
                                        lifetime error.
                                        The suggested external port and/or external address cannot be provided. This error MUST only be
                                        returned for: * MAP requests that included the PREFER_FAILURE Option (normal MAP requests will
   11      CANNOT_PROVIDE_EXTERNAL      return an available external port); * MAP requests for the SCTP protocol (PREFER_FAILURE is       [RFC6887]
                                        implied); * PEER requests. See Section 13.2 of [RFC6887] for processing details. The error
                                        lifetime depends on the reason for the failure.
                                        The source IP address of the request packet does not match the contents of the PCP Client's IP
   12      ADDRESS_MISMATCH             Address field, due to an unexpected NAT on the path between the PCP client and the PCP-controlled [RFC6887]
                                        NAT or firewall. This is a long lifetime error.
                                        The PCP server was not able to create the filters in this request. This result code MUST only be
   13      EXCESSIVE_REMOTE_PEERS       returned if the MAP request contained the FILTER Option. See Section 13.3 for processing          [RFC6887]
                                        information. This is a long lifetime error.
   14      INITIATION                   The client includes this PCP result code in its request to the server for authentication.         [RFC7652]
   15      AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED      This error response is sent to the client if EAP authentication is required.                      [RFC7652]
   16      AUTHENTICATION_FAILED        This error response is sent to the client if EAP authentication failed.                           [RFC7652]
   17      AUTHENTICATION_SUCCEEDED     This success response is sent to the client if EAP authentication succeeded.                      [RFC7652]
   18      AUTHORIZATION_FAILED         This error response is sent to the client if EAP authentication succeeded but authorization       [RFC7652]
                                        failed.
   19      SESSION_TERMINATED           This PCP result code indicates to the partner that the PA session must be terminated.             [RFC7652]
   20      UNKNOWN_SESSION_ID           This error response is sent from the PCP server if there is no known PA session associated with   [RFC7652]
                                        the Session ID sent in the PA request or common PCP request from the PCP client.
   21      DOWNGRADE_ATTACK_DETECTED    This PCP result code indicates to the client that the server detected a downgrade attack.         [RFC7652]
   22      AUTHENTICATION_REQUEST       The server indicates to the client that the PA message contains an EAP request.                   [RFC7652]
   23      AUTHENTICATION_REPLY         The client indicates to the server that the PA message contains an EAP response.                  [RFC7652]
   24      THIRD_PARTY_ID_UNKNOWN       The provided identifier in a THIRD_PARTY_ID option is unknown/unavailable to the PCP server. This [RFC7843]
                                        is a long lifetime error.
   25      THIRD_PARTY_MISSING_OPTION   This error occurs if both THIRD_PARTY and THIRD_PARTY_ID options are expected in a request but    [RFC7843]
                                        one option is missing. This is a long lifetime error.
   26      UNSUPP_THIRD_PARTY_ID_LENGTH The received option length is not supported. This is a long lifetime error.                       [RFC7843]
