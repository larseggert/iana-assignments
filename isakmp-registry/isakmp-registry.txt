IPSEC Situation Definition

   Registration Procedure(s)

 Registry closed

   Reference
   [RFC2407][RFC9395]

   Note

 The Situation Definition is a 32-bit bitmask which represents the
 environment under which the IPSEC SA proposal and negotiation is
 carried out.  Requests for assignments of new situations must be
 accompanied by an RFC which describes the interpretation for the
 associated bit.

 If the RFC is not on the standards-track (i.e., it is an informational
 or experimental RFC), it must be explicitly reviewed and approved by
 the IESG before the RFC is published and the transform identifier is
 assigned.

 The upper two bits are reserved for private use amongst cooperating
 systems.

IPSEC Security Protocol Identifiers

   Registration Procedure(s)

 Registry closed

   Reference
   [RFC2407][RFC9395]

   Note

 The Security Protocol Identifier is an 8-bit value which identifies a
 security protocol suite being negotiated.  Requests for assignments of
 new security protocol identifiers must be accompanied by an RFC which
 describes the requested security protocol.  [AH] and [ESP] are
 examples of security protocol documents.

 If the RFC is not on the standards-track (i.e., it is an informational
 or experimental RFC), it must be explicitly reviewed and approved by
 the IESG before the RFC is published and the transform identifier is
 assigned.

 Registry closed

   Reference
   [RFC2407][RFC9395]

   Note

 The IPSEC ISAKMP Transform Identifier is an 8-bit value which
 identifies a key exchange protocol to be used for the negotiation.
 Requests for assignments of new ISAKMP transform identifiers must be
 accompanied by an RFC which describes the requested key exchange
 protocol.  [IKE] is an example of one such document.

 If the RFC is not on the standards-track (i.e., it is an informational
 or experimental RFC), it must be explicitly reviewed and approved by
 the IESG before the RFC is published and the transform identifier is
 assigned.

   Note

 The IPSEC ESP Transform Identifier is an 8-bit value which identifies
 a particular algorithm to be used to provide secrecy protection for
 ESP.  Requests for assignments of new ESP transform identifiers must
 be accompanied by an RFC which describes how to use the algorithm
 within the ESP framework ([ESP]).

 If the RFC is not on the standards-track (i.e., it is an informational

   Note

 The IPSEC IPCOMP Transform Identifier is an 8-bit value which
 identifier a particular algorithm to be used to provide IP-level
 compression before ESP.  Requests for assignments of new IPCOMP
 transform identifiers must be accompanied by an RFC which describes
 how to use the algorithm within the IPCOMP framework ([IPCOMP]).  In
 addition, the requested algorithm must be published and in the public
 domain.

 If the RFC is not on the standards-track (i.e., it is an informational
 or experimental RFC), it must be explicitly reviewed and approved by
 the IESG before the RFC is published and the transform identifier is
 assigned.

   [RFC2407][RFC9395]

   Note

 The IPSEC Security Association Attribute consists of a 16-bit type and
 its associated value.  IPSEC SA attributes are used to pass
 miscellaneous values between ISAKMP peers.  Requests for assignments
 of new IPSEC SA attributes must be accompanied by an Internet Draft
 which describes the attribute encoding (Basic/Variable-Length) and its
 legal values.  Section 4.5 of this document provides an example of
 such a description.

   Note

 The IPSEC Labeled Domain Identifier is a 32-bit value which identifies

 values are said to exist.  Requests for assignments of new IPSEC
 Labeled Domain Identifiers should be granted on demand.  No
 accompanying documentation is required, though Internet Drafts are
 encouraged when appropriate.

IPSEC Identification Type

   Registration Procedure(s)

 Registry closed

   Reference
   [RFC2407][RFC9395]

   Note

 The IPSEC Identification Type is an 8-bit value which is used as a
 discriminant for interpretation of the variable-length Identification
 Payload.  Requests for assignments of new IPSEC Identification Types
 must be accompanied by an RFC which describes how to use the
 identification type within IPSEC.

 If the RFC is not on the standards track (i.e., it is an informational
 or experimental RFC), it must be explicitly reviewed and approved by
 the IESG before the RFC is published and the transform identifier is
 assigned.

   Note

 The IPSEC Notify Message Type is a 16-bit value taken from the range
 of values reserved by ISAKMP for each DOI.  There is one range for
 error messages (8192-16383) and a different range for status messages
 (24576-32767).  Requests for assignments of new Notify Message Types
 must be accompanied by an Internet Draft which describes how to use
 the identification type within IPSEC.

   [1] This is combined mode cipher, but combined mode algorithms are not
       a ature of IPsec-v2. Although some IKEv1/IPsec-v2 implementations
       inude this capability (see [RFC6071] Section 5.4), it is not part of
       thprotocol.
