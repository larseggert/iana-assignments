   Number    Default Reponse String                                               Description                                             Reference
   200    Success                      The request was successfully processed.                                                            [RFC6503]
   400    Bad Request                  The request was badly formed in some fashion.                                                      [RFC6503]
   401    Unauthorized                 The user was not authorized for the specific operation on the conference object.                   [RFC6503]
   403    Forbidden                    The specific operation is not valid for the target conference object.                              [RFC6503]
   404    Object Not Found             The specific conference object was not found.                                                      [RFC6503]
                                       A requested operation cannot be successfully completed by the server. For example, the
   409    Conflict                     modification of an object cannot be applied because the client version of the object is obsolete   [RFC6503]
                                       and the requested modifications collide with the up-to-date state of the object stored at the
                                       server.
   420    User Not Found               The user who is the target of the requested operation is unknown.                                  [RFC6503]
   421    Invalid confUserID           The "confUserID" of the sender in the request is invalid.                                          [RFC6503]
   422    Invalid Conference Password  A request to access/manipulate a password-protected conference object contained an invalid         [RFC6503]
                                       "conference-password" parameter.
   423    Conference Password Required A request to access/manipulate a password-protected conference object did not contain a            [RFC6503]
                                       "conference-password" parameter.
   424    Authentication Required      The server wants to authenticate the request through the "subject" parameter but the parameter is  [RFC6503]
                                       not provided in the request.
   425    Forbidden Delete Parent      The conferencing system cannot system cannot delete the specific conference object because it is a [RFC6503]
                                       parent for another conference object.
   426    Forbidden Change Protected   The target conference object cannot be changed (e.g., due to policies, roles or privileges).       [RFC6503]
   427    Invalid Domain Name          The domain name in an AUTO_GENERATE_X instance in the conference object is not within the          [RFC6503]
                                       conference server's domain of responsibility.
   500    Server Internal Error        The conference server experienced some sort of internal error.                                     [RFC6503]
   501    Not Implemented              The specific operation is not implemented on the conferencing system.                              [RFC6503]
   510    Request Timeout              The request could not be processed within a reasonable time (as specified by the conferencing      [RFC6503]
                                       system).
   511    Resources Not Available      The conference server cannot execute a command because of resource issues, e.g. it cannot create a [RFC6503]
                                       conference because the system has reached its limits on the number of conferences.
