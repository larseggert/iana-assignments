   Reference
           [RFC3241]

   Note

 The ROHC suboption identifier is a non-negative integer.
 The IANA policy for assigning new values for the suboption
 identifier shall be Specification Required: values and their
 meanings must be documented in an RFC or in some other permanent
 and readily available reference, in sufficient detail that
 interoperability between independent implementations is possible.

 The range 0 to 127 is reserved for IETF standard-track
 specifications; the range 128 to 254 is available for other
 specifications that meet this requirement (such as Informational
 RFCs). The value 255 is reserved for future extensibility of the
 present specification.
