   Note

 In the FTP Operation Over Big Address Records (FOOBAR) Protocol
 [RFC1639] there is a field, called "address family" or "af", to
 identify the lower level protocol addresses in use.  This is an 8 bit
 field.  The first 16 assignments (0-15) of the af value are exactly
 the same as the IP Version number.  The assignment for values 16-255
 are listed here.
