Header field name: Errors-To
Applicable protocol: mail
Status: deprecated
Author/Change controller: IETF
Specification document(s): RFC 2076, section 3.5
Related information:
Errors-To is mentioned in RFC 1035 3.3.7 and RFC 2076 3.5,
but it was never formally standardized.

Errors-To is used by some mailing lists to reflect their
envelope-sender address in the message header, typically
the same as the Return-Path.

Use of this header field is considered harmful and is
strongly discouraged. Especially it won't help for the
"Sender ID" scheme specified in RFC 4406 (Historic).
