Header field name: Apparently-To
Applicable protocol: mail
Status: deprecated
Author/Change controller: IETF
Specification document(s): RFC 2076, section 3.4
Related information:
This header field was never formally standardized. It
was added by a popular mailer in absence of recipient
header fields (To, Cc, Bcc) listing all envelope RCPT TO
addresses, thereby disclosing the addresses of blind
carbon copies to all recipients.

Mentioned in RFC 1211 appendix F.18.a and RFC 2076 3.4,
discussed in RFC 2821 7.2 (summary: "SHOULD NOT be used"),
this was later copied verbatim into RFC 3552 6.1.1.2.
