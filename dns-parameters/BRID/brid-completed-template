D. Motivation for the new RRTYPE application.

This RRTYPE is to be used for the lookup of static information
fields found in the ASTM F3411 standard for Remote ID (RID). It is
primarily focused on Broadcast RID information elements as having
them present in DNS would allow Observers to perform a lookup to
obtain anything missed.

E. Description of the proposed RR type.

The UAS Broadcast RID RRType (BRID) is a format to hold
public information typically sent of the UAS Broadcast RID that is static.
It can act as a data source if information is not received over
Broadcast RID or for cross validation.

The wire format of the RDATA section is CBOR-encoded data.

The CDDL specification for the CBOR-encoded data is as follows:

bcast-rr = {
    uas_type => nibble-field,
    uas_ids => [+ uas-id-grp],
    ? auth => [+ auth-grp],
    ? self_id => self-grp,
    ? area => area-grp,
    ? classification => classification-grp,
    ? operator_id => operator-grp
}
uas-id-grp = [
    id_type: &uas-id-types,
    uas_id: bstr .size(20)
]
auth-grp = [
    a_type: &auth-types,
    a_data: bstr .size(1..362)
]
area-grp = [
    area_count: 1..255,
    area_radius: float,  # in decameters
    area_floor: float,   # wgs84-hae in meters
    area_ceiling: float  # wgs84-hae in meters
]
classification-grp = [
    class_type: 0..8,
    class: nibble-field,
    category: nibble-field
]
self-grp = [
    desc_type: 0..255,
    description: tstr .size(23)
]
operator-grp = [
    operator_id_type: 0..255,
    operator_id: bstr .size(20)
]
uas-id-types = (none: 0, serial: 1, session_id: 4)
auth-types = (none: 0, specific_method: 5)
nibble-field = 0..15
uas_type = 0
uas_ids = 1
auth = 2
self_id = 3
area = 4
classification = 5
operator_id = 6

The presentation format of the RDATA section is the base64-encoded CBOR data.

F. What existing RRTYPE or RRTYPEs come closest to filling that need
    and why are they unsatisfactory?

None.

G. What mnemonic is requested for the new RRTYPE (optional)?

BRID

H. Does the requested RRTYPE make use of any existing IANA registry
    or require the creation of a new IANA subregistry in DNS
    Parameters?

No.

I. Does the proposal require/expect any changes in DNS
    servers/resolvers that prevent the new type from being processed
    as an unknown RRTYPE (see [RFC3597])?

No.

J. Comments:

None.
