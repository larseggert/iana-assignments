D. Motivation for the new RRTYPE application.

This RRTYPE is to be used for any Hierarchial Host Identity Tag (HHIT)
as defined in RFC9374 as part of its registation into the hierarchy.
HHITs SHOULD be registered to an authority entity, thus being associated
with an endorsement or certificate (held in this RRTYPE) of that
registration.

E. Description of the proposed RR type.

The HHIT RRType (HHIT) is a metadata record for various bits of HHIT
specific information that isn't available in the pre-existing HIP RRType.

The wire format of the RDATA section is CBOR-encoded data.

The CDDL specification for the CBOR-encoded data is as follows:

hhit-rr = [
    hhit-entity-type: uint,
    hid-abbreviation: tstr .size(15),
    canonical-registration-cert: bstr
]

The presentation format of the RDATA section is the base64-encoded CBOR data.

F. What existing RRTYPE or RRTYPEs come closest to filling that need
    and why are they unsatisfactory?

The HIP RRTYPE (55). The HIP RRTYPE does not contain a method to
provide proof/trust into the registration of an HHIT that is found in
the certificate of the proposed RRTYPE.

G. What mnemonic is requested for the new RRTYPE (optional)?

HHIT

H. Does the requested RRTYPE make use of any existing IANA registry
    or require the creation of a new IANA subregistry in DNS
    Parameters?

No.

I. Does the proposal require/expect any changes in DNS
    servers/resolvers that prevent the new type from being processed
    as an unknown RRTYPE (see [RFC3597])?

No.

J. Comments:

None.
