           [RFC2743]

   Note

 A service is a resource provided to network clients; often provided by
 more than one server and potentially by more than one protocol.
 Service names are short alphanumeric textual strings.  Service names
 are used in the GSSAPI [RFC2743] host-service name form, are specified
 as part of a SASL profile [RFC4422] and are used by Kerberos
 service-based tickets [RFC1510]. Registrations are restricted to
 alphanumeric characters and the characters '+', '-' and '.'
