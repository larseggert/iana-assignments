Milnet Link Numbers

   Registration Procedure(s)

 Registry closed

   Note

 The word "link" here refers to a field in the original MILNET Host/IMP
 interface leader.  The link was originally defined as an 8-bit field.
 Later specifications defined this field as the "message-id" with a
 length of 12 bits.  The name link now refers to the high order 8 bits of
 this 12-bit message-id field.  The Host/IMP interface is defined in BBN
 Report 1822 [BBN, "Specifications for the Interconnection of a Host and
 an IMP", Report 1822, Bolt Beranek and Newman, Cambridge,
 Massachusetts, revised, December 1981.].

 The low-order 4 bits of the message-id field are called the sub-link.
 Unless explicitly specified otherwise for a particular protocol, there
 is no sender to receiver significance to the sub-link.  The sender may
 use the sub-link in any way he chooses (it is returned in the RFNM by
 the destination IMP), the receiver should ignore the sub-link.

Milnet Logical Addresses

   Registration Procedure(s)

 Registry closed

   Note

 The MILNET facility for "logical addressing" is described in [RFC878]
 and [RFC1005].  A portion of the possible logical addresses are
 reserved for standard uses.

 There are 49,152 possible logical host addresses.  Of these, 256 are
 reserved for assignment to well-known functions.  Assignments for
 well-known functions are made by the IANA.  Assignments for other
 logical host addresses are made by the NIC.

Milnet X.25 Address Mappings

   Registration Procedure(s)

 Registry closed

   Note

 All MILNET hosts are assigned addresses by the Defense Data Network
 (DDN).  The address of a MILNET host may be obtained from the Network
 Information Center (NIC), represented as an ASCII text string in what
 is called "host table format".  This section describes the process by
 which MILNET X.25 addresses may be derived from addresses in the NIC
 host table format.

 A NIC host table address consists of the ASCII text string
 representations of four decimal numbers separated by periods,
 corresponding to the four octeted of a thirty-two bit Internet
 address.  The four decimal numbers are referred to in this section as
 "n", "h' "l", and "i".  Thus, a host table address may be represented
 as: "n.h.l.i".  Each of these four numbers will have either one, two,
 or three decimal digits and will never have a value greater than 255.
 For example, in the host table, address: "10.2.0.124", n=10, h=2, l=0,
 and i=124.  To convert a host table address to a MILNET X.25 address:

 1.  If h < 64, the host table address corresponds to the X.25
 physical address:


 ZZZZ F IIIHHZZ (SS)

 where:

      ZZZZ = 0000    as required

      F = 0          because the address is a physical address;

      III            is a three decimal digit respresentation of
                     "i", right-adjusted and padded with leading
                     zeros if required;

      HH             is a two decimal digit representation of "h",
                     right-adjusted and padded with leading zeros
                     if required;

      ZZ = 00        and

      (SS)           is optional


 In the example given above, the host table address 10.2.0.124
 corresponds to the X.25 physical address 000001240200.

 2.  If h > 64 or h = 64, the host table address corresponds to the
 X.25 logical address


 ZZZZ F RRRRRZZ (SS)

 where:

      ZZZZ = 0000    as required

      F = 1          because the address is a logical address;

      RRRRR          is a five decimal digit representation of
                     the result "r" of the calculation

                              r = h * 256 + i

                     (Note that the decimal representation of
                     "r" will always require five digits);

      ZZ = 00        and

      (SS)           is optional

 Thus, the host table address 10.83.0.207 corresponds to the X.25
 logical address 000012145500.

 In both cases, the "n" and "l" fields of the host table address are
 not used.
