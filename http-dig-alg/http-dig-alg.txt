    Digest                                 Description                                                          Reference
   Algorithm
             The ADLER32 algorithm is a checksum specified in RFC1950 "ZLIB
             Compressed Data Format". The 32-bit output is encoded in hexadecimal
   ADLER32   (using between 1 and 8 ASCII characters from 0-9, A-F, and a-f; leading  [RFC1950][RFC3309][Paul_Millar]
             0's are allowed). For example, ADLER32=03da0195 and ADLER32=3DA0195 are
             both valid checksums for the 4-byte message "Wiki".
             The CRC32c algorithm is a 32-bit cyclic redundancy check. It achieves a
             better hamming distance (for better error-detection performance) than
             many other 32-bit CRC functions. Other places it is used include iSCSI
   CRC32c    and SCTP. The 32-bit output is encoded in hexadecimal (using between 1   [RFC9260, Appendix A]
             and 8 ASCII characters from 0-9, A-F, and a-f; leading 0's are allowed).
             For example, CRC32c=0a72a4df and crc32c=A72A4DF are both valid checksums
             for the 3-byte message "dog".
