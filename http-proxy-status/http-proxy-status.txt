   error           The error parameter's value is a Token that is a proxy error type. When present, it indicates [RFC-ietf-httpbis-proxy-status-08]
                   that the intermediary encountered an issue when obtaining this response.
                   The next-hop parameter's value is a String or Token that identifies the intermediary or
   next-hop        origin server selected (and used, if contacted) to obtain this response. It might be a        [RFC-ietf-httpbis-proxy-status-08]
                   hostname, IP address, or alias.
                   The next-protocol parameter's value indicates the Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation
   next-protocol   (ALPN) protocol identifier [RFC7301] of the protocol used by the intermediary to connect to   [RFC-ietf-httpbis-proxy-status-08]
                   the next hop when obtaining this response.
   received-status The received-status parameter's value indicates the HTTP status code that the intermediary    [RFC-ietf-httpbis-proxy-status-08]
                   received from the next-hop server when obtaining this response.
   details         The details parameter's value is a String containing additional information not captured      [RFC-ietf-httpbis-proxy-status-08]
                   anywhere else. This can include implementation-specific or deployment-specific information.
