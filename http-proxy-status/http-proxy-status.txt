   error           The error parameter's value is a Token that is a proxy error type. When present, it indicates that the intermediary    [RFC9209]
                   encountered an issue when obtaining this response.
   next-hop        The next-hop parameter's value is a String or Token that identifies the intermediary or origin server selected (and    [RFC9209]
                   used, if contacted) to obtain this response. It might be a hostname, IP address, or alias.
   next-protocol   The next-protocol parameter's value indicates the Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) protocol identifier    [RFC9209]
                   [RFC7301] of the protocol used by the intermediary to connect to the next hop when obtaining this response.
   received-status The received-status parameter's value indicates the HTTP status code that the intermediary received from the next-hop  [RFC9209]
                   server when obtaining this response.
   details         The details parameter's value is a String containing additional information not captured anywhere else. This can       [RFC9209]
                   include implementation-specific or deployment-specific information.
