Reserved IPv6 Interface Identifiers

   Registration Procedure(s)

 Standards Action

   Reference
           [RFC5453][RFC7136]

   Note

 Full deployment of a new reserved IID value would require updates to
 IID generation code in every deployed IPv6 stack, so the technical
 justification for such a Standards Action would need to be extremely
 strong.
