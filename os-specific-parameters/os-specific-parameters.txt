                             the Fact
                              Value
                                       From IEEE Std 1003.1-2004 XBD 4.7 "File Times Update"
                                       [http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/xbd_chap04.html#tag_04_07]: "st_ctime
                                       is associated with the times that the file status is changed."
                            "time-val"
    Unix   Unix.ctime       from       This is clarified in the operations described throughout IEEE Std 1003.1-2004 XSH 3 "System    [Paul_Millar]
                            [RFC3659]  Interfaces."

                                       Although IEEE Std 1003.1-2004 only considers st_ctime as having second resolution,
                                       platform-specific extensions exist that provide st_ctime semantics but with sub-second
                                       resolution. Unix.ctime values from such platforms MAY use such finer-grain resolution.
                                       From IEEE Std 1003.1-2004 XBD 4.7 "File Times Update"
                                       [http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/xbd_chap04.html#tag_04_07]: "The
                                       st_atime field is associated with the times that the file data is accessed."

    Unix   Unix.atime       from                                                                                                      [Paul_Millar]
                            [RFC3659]  Although IEEE Std 1003.1-2004 only considers st_atime as having second resolution,

                                       For performance reasons, some platforms allow operations to delay or suppress updates to
                                       st_atime. FTP servers on such platforms MAY refrain from publishing the Unix.atime fact.
