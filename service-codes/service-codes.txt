   Note

 Service Codes are big-endian 32-bit numbers.  Some Service Codes also have an
 ASCII string representation; when a Service Code may be represented in "SC:"
 format according to the rules in [RFC4340], Section 8.1.2, the ASCII column
 shall provide that interpretation.  Here is an example allocation:

 1717858426             fdpz    Frobodyne Plotz Protocol          [RFCWXYZ]

 Service Codes whose high-order 8 bits equal the value 63 (ASCII '?') are
 reserved for Private Use; this is the range 1056964608-1073741823.  Service
 Codes whose component bytes' values are each in the set {32, 45-57, 65-90}
 are allocated using the Specification Required policy (this corresponds
 to no simple range).  All other Service Codes are allocated using the
 First Come First Serve (FCFS) policy.

 See the following Javascript program to analyze one or more Service Codes,
 given numerically or as strings:
