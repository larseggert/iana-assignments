   [1] The Return Subcode (RSC) contains the point in the label stack where pro-
       cessing was terminated. If the RSC is 0, no labels were processed.
       Otherwise, the packet was label switched at depth RSC.
   [2] The Return Code is per "Downstream Detailed Mapping TLV" (Section 3.4).
       This Return Code MUST be used only in the message header and MUST be set
       only in the MPLS echo reply message. If the Return Code is set in the
       MPLS echo request message, then it MUST be ignored. When this Return
       Code is set, each Downstream Detailed Mapping TLV MUST have an
       appropriate Return Code and Return Subcode. This Return Code
       MUST be used when there are multiple downstreams for a given
       node (such as Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP)or ECMP),and the
       node needs to return a Return Code/Return Subcode for
       each downstream. This Return Code MAY be used even
       when there is only one downstream for a given node.
