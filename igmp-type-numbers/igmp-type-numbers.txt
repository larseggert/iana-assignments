   Note

 The Internet Group Message Protocol (IGMP) has many messages
 that are identified by a "type" field.

 Note that the original definition of IGMP in [RFC1112] divided
 this field into two 4-bit values, "version" and "type".  This
 was decided to be too restrictive, so the fields were combined
 into a single 8-bit type space.
