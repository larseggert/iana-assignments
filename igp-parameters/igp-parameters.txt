           Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm based on link metric. This is the standard shortest path algorithm as computed
   0       by the IGP protocol. Consistent with the deployed practice for link-state protocols, Algorithm 0 permits any node   [RFC8665]
           to overwrite the SPF path with a different path based on its local policy.
           Strict Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm based on link metric. The algorithm is identical to Algorithm 0 but
   1       Algorithm 1 requires that all nodes along the path will honor the SPF routing decision. Local policy at the node    [RFC8665]
           claiming support for Algorithm 1 MUST NOT alter the SPF paths computed by Algorithm 1.
