           Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm based on link metric. This is the standard shortest path algorithm as
   0       computed by the IGP protocol. Consistent with the deployed practice for link-state protocols, Algorithm 0     [RFC8665]
           permits any node to overwrite the SPF path with a different path based on its local policy.
           Strict Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm based on link metric. The algorithm is identical to Algorithm 0
   1       but Algorithm 1 requires that all nodes along the path will honor the SPF routing decision. Local policy at   [RFC8665]
           the node claiming support for Algorithm 1 MUST NOT alter the SPF paths computed by Algorithm 1.
