           Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm based on link metric. This is the standard shortest path algorithm as computed
   0       by the IGP protocol. Consistent with the deployed practice for link-state protocols, Algorithm 0 permits any node   [RFC8665]
           to overwrite the SPF path with a different path based on its local policy.
           Strict Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm based on link metric. The algorithm is identical to Algorithm 0 but
   1       Algorithm 1 requires that all nodes along the path will honor the SPF routing decision. Local policy at the node    [RFC8665]
           claiming support for Algorithm 1 MUST NOT alter the SPF paths computed by Algorithm 1.

   1               any color that is part of the exclude rule is also set on the link. [RFC9350, Section 13]
                   If such a color is set, the link MUST be pruned from the
                   computation.
                   Check if any exclude SRLG rule is part of the Flex-Algorithm
   2               Definition. If such exclude rule exists, check if the link is part  [RFC9350, Section 13]
                   of any SRLG that is also part of the SRLG exclude rule. If the link
                   is part of such SRLG, the link MUST be pruned from the computation.
                   Check if any include-any Administrative Group rule is part of the
                   Flex-Algorithm Definition. If such include-any rule exists, check
   3               if any color that is part of the include-any rule is also set on    [RFC9350, Section 13]
                   the link. If no such color is set, the link MUST be pruned from the
                   computation.
                   Check if any include-all Administrative Group rule is part of the
                   Flex-Algorithm Definition. If such include-all rule exists, check

                   the link. If all such colors are not set on the link, the link MUST
                   be pruned from the computation.
                   If the Flex-Algorithm Definition uses something other than the IGP
                   metric (Section 5 of [RFC9350]), and such metric is not advertised

                   value 0 MUST NOT be assumed in such a case.
                   Check if any exclude FAEMB rule is part of the Flex-Algorithm
                   definition. If such exclude rule exists and the link has Maximum

                   link MUST be pruned from the Flex-Algorithm computation.
                   Check if any exclude FAEMD rule is part of the Flex-Algorithm
                   definition. If such exclude rule exists and the link has Min

                   satisfies the FAEMD rule. If the link does not satisfy the FAEMD
                   rule, the link MUST be pruned from the Flex-Algorithm computation.
                   Check if any exclude reverse Admin Group rule is part of the
                   Flex-Algorithm definition. If such exclude rule exists, check if
   8               any Admin Group that is part of the exclude rule is also set on the [RFC-ietf-lsr-igp-flex-algo-reverse-affinity-12, Section 11]
                   link in the reverse direction. If such Admin Group is set on the

                   Check if any include-all reverse Admin Group rule is part of the
