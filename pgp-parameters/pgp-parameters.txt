 Notation names are arbitrary strings encoded in

 The IETF name space is registered with IANA. These
 names MUST NOT contain the "@" character (0x40).
 This is a tag for the user name space.

Key Flags Extensions

   Registration Procedure(s)

 IETF Review

   Reference
           [RFC4880]

   Note

 The flags in this packet may appear in self-signatures or in
 certification signatures. They mean different things depending on
 who is making the statement -- for example, a certification
 signature that has the "sign data" flag is stating that the
 certification is for that use. On the other hand, the
 "communications encryption" flag in a self-signature is stating a
 preference that a given key be used for communications. Note
 however, that it is a thorny issue to determine what is
 "communications" and what is "storage." This decision is left wholly
 up to the implementation; the authors of this document do not claim
 any special wisdom on the issue, and realize that accepted opinion
 may change.

 The "split key" (0x10) and "group key" (0x80) flags are placed on a
 self-signature only; they are meaningless on a certification
 signature. They SHOULD be placed only on a direct-key signature
 (type 0x1f) or a subkey signature (type 0x18), one that refers to
 the key the flag applies to.
