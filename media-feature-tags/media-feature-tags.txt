   1       sip.audio       This feature tag indicates that the device supports audio as a streaming media type.                           [RFC3840]
                           This feature tag indicates that the device supports application as a streaming media type. This feature tag
   2       sip.application exists primarily for completeness. Since so many MIME types are underneath application, indicating the ability [RFC3840]
                           to support applications provides little useful information.
   3       sip.data        This feature tag indicates that the device supports data as a streaming media type.                            [RFC3840]
   4       sip.control     This feature tag indicates that the device supports control as a streaming media type.                         [RFC3840]
   5       sip.video       This feature tag indicates that the device supports video as a streaming media type.                           [RFC3840]
   6       sip.text        This feature tag indicates that the device supports text as a streaming media type.                            [RFC3840]
   7       sip.automata    The sip.automata feature tag is a boolean value that indicates whether the UA represents an automata (such as  [RFC3840]
                           a voicemail server, conference server, IVR, or recording device) or a human.
   8       sip.class       This feature tag indicates the setting, business or personal, in which a communications device is used.        [RFC3840]
                           The sip.duplex media feature tag indicates whether a communications device can simultaneously send and receive
   9       sip.duplex      media ("full"), alternate between sending and receiving ("half"), can only receive ("receive-only") or only    [RFC3840]
                           send ("send-only").
                           The sip.mobility feature tag indicates whether the device is fixed (meaning that it is associated with a fixed
   10      sip.mobility    point of contact with the network), or mobile (meaning that it is not associated with a fixed point of         [RFC3840]
                           contact). Note that cordless phones are fixed, not mobile, based on this definition.
   11      sip.description The sip.description feature tag provides a textual description of the device.                                  [RFC3840]
   12      sip.events      Each feature tag value indicates a SIP event package supported by a SIP UA. The values for this tag equal the  [RFC3840]
                           event package names that are registered by each event package.
                           The sip.priority feature tag indicates the call priorities the device is willing to handle. A value of X means
   13      sip.priority    that the device is willing to take requests with priority X and higher. This does not imply that a phone has   [RFC3840]
                           to reject calls of lower priority. As always, the decision on handling of such calls is a matter of local
                           policy.
                           Each value of the sip.methods (note the plurality) feature tag indicates a SIP method supported by this UA. In
   14      sip.methods     this case, "supported" means that the UA can receive requests with this method. In that sense, it has the same [RFC3840]
                           connotation as the Allow header field.
                           Each value of the sip.extensions feature tag is a SIP extension (each of which is defined by an option-tag
   15      sip.extensions  registered with IANA) that is understood by the UA. Understood, in this context, means that the option tag     [RFC3840]
                           would be included in a Supported header field in a request.
                           Each value of the sip.schemes (note the plurality) media feature tag indicates a URI scheme that is supported
   16      sip.schemes     by a UA. Supported implies, for example, that the UA would know how to handle a URI of that scheme in the      [RFC3840]
                           Contact header field of a redirect response.
   17      sip.actor       This feature tag indicates the type of entity that is available at this URI.                                   [RFC3840]
   18      sip.isfocus     This feature tag indicates that the UA is a conference server, also known as a focus, and will mix together    [RFC3840]
                           the media for all calls to the same URI.
   19      sip.byeless     The feature tag is a boolean flag. When set it indicates that the device is incapable of terminating a session [RFC4235]
                           autonomously.
                           This feature tag contains one of three tokens indicating if the device is rendering any media from the current
   20      sip.rendering   session ("yes"), none of the media from the current session ("no"), or if this status is not known to the      [RFC4235]
                           device ("unknown").
   21      sip.message     This feature tag indicates that the device supports message as a streaming media type.                         [RFC4569]
   22      sip.ice         This feature tag indicates that the device supports Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE).              [RFC5768]
                           This feature tag contains a string containing a URN that indicates a unique identifier associated with the UA
                           instance registering the Contact. Values appropriate for use with this feature tag: String (equality
   23      sip.instance    relationship). The feature tag is intended primarily for use in the following applications, protocols,         [RFC5626]
                           services, or negotiation mechanisms: This feature tag is most useful in a communications application, for
                           describing the capabilities of a device, such as a phone or PDA.
   24      sip.app-subtype This feature tag indicates the MIME application sub-types supported by the agent for purposes of streaming     [RFC5688]
                           media.
   25      sip.fax         This feature tag indicates whether a communications device supports the ITU-T T.38 fax protocol ("t38") or the [RFC6913]
                           passthrough method of fax transmission using the ITU-T G.711 audio codec ("passthrough").
   26      sip.uui-isdn    This media feature tag when used in a Contact header field of a SIP request or a SIP response indicates that   [RFC7434]
                           the entity sending the SIP message supports the package "uui-isdn".
   27      sip.src         This feature tag indicates that the UA is a Session Recording Client for the purpose of an RS.                 [RFC7866]
   28      sip.srs         This feature tag indicates that the UA is a Session Recording Server for the purpose of an RS.                 [RFC7866]
                           This media feature tag, when inserted in the Contact header field of a SIP REGISTER request, conveys that the
   29      sip.pnsreg      SIP UA associated with the tag is able to send binding-refresh REGISTER requests associated with the           [RFC8599]
                           registration without being awakened by push notifications.
                           This feature tag indicates that the device supports CLUE-controlled media. Values appropriate for use with
                           this feature tag: Boolean. The feature tag is intended primarily for use in the following applications,
   30      sip.clue        protocols, services, or negotiation mechanisms: This feature tag is most useful in a communications            [RFC8848]
