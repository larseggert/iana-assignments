Media type name: image

Media subtype name: jaii

Required parameters: N/A

Optional parameters: The same as for the media type image/heif. The presence of an image item of type 'jaii' is signalled by including in the itemtypes parameter, an item description whose item type string starts with 'jai0' followed by a dot ('.'), further followed by a series of dot-separated ('.') values from the JPEGAIHeaderProperty() as specified in subclause B.2.3 of Rec. ITU-T T.JPEG-AI-FF | ISO/IEC 6048-5, starting from stream_profile_idc, up to and including level_idc, each encoded as a hexadecimal number.

Encoding considerations: binary

Security considerations: See the media type image/heif. In addition, image items of type 'jaii' contain structures of variable length and have an extensible syntax. Both aspects present potential security risks for implementations. In particular, variable length structures present buffer overflow risks and extensible syntax could result in the triggering of adverse actions.

Interoperability considerations: The same as for the media type image/heif. In addition, image items of type 'jaii' can conform to one of several profiles and/or require one of several capabilities, e.g. as specified in Rec. ITU-T T.JPEG-AI-P | ISO/IEC 6048-2, not all of which are necessarily supported by a receiving decoder. As a result, decoders might attempt to process the contents only to determine that they cannot be rendered either partially or in full.

Published specification: Rec. ITU-T T.JPEG-AI-FF | ISO/IEC 6048-5, JPEG AI learning-based Image Coding â€” Part 5: File format

Applications which use this media: Use of single images in Multimedia, Imaging, Pictures, Scientific

Fragment identifier considerations: The same as for the media type image/heif
