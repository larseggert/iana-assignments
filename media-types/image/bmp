(registered by RFC-seantek-windows-image-03)

Type name: image

Subtype name: bmp

Required parameters: None.

Optional parameters: None.

Encoding considerations: Binary.

Security considerations:

  Bitmaps have a mostly unremarkable security history.

  Because BMP data can encapsulate JPEG or PNG data (BI_JPEG, BI_PNG
  values of the Compression enumeration in Section 2.1.1.7 of the
  WMF specification), the security considerations of JPEG and PNG
  processing may also apply to BMP.

Interoperability considerations:

  Uncompressed Windows Bitmaps can be rather large.  If there is a
  need to compress an image, modern applications SHOULD consider
  emitting JPEG or PNG data instead of embedding them in BMP
  payloads.

Published specification:

  WMF: Microsoft Corporation, "[MS-WMF]: Windows Metafile Format",
  v20140502 (Rev 11.1), May 2014,

  BMP: Microsoft Corporation, "Bitmap Storage", MSDN ID dd183391,
  2014, <http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd183391>.

Applications that use this media type:

  Office productivity applications; clip art applications; desktop
  publishing applications; web browsers; graphics processing
  applications.

Fragment identifier considerations: None.

Additional information:

  Magic number(s):
     42 4D ("BM"), meaning "bitmap".  The next field
     (BITMAPFILEHEADER bfSize) is a little-endian DWORD indicating
     the size of the bitmap content in bytes.

  File extension(s): .bmp, .dib

  Macintosh file type code(s):
     "BMP ", "BMPf", or "BMPp".  Apple has promulgated a uniform
     type identifier (UTI) of "com.microsoft.bmp".
