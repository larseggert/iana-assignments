Media type name: image
Media subtype name: aces

Required parameters: none

Optional parameters:
none

Encoding considerations: binary

Security considerations:
ACES Image Container files utilize a structure which can store image data and attributes of this image data. The fields defined in the ACES Image Container specification are of a descriptive nature and provide information that is useful to facilitate the viewing and rendering of images by a recipient, along with additional metadata not required for viewing and rendering, but which may be helpful in the use of the image in the context of a larger project, such as the accomplishment of a motion picture or television project. As such, the fields currently defined in the ACES Image Container specification do not in themselves create additional security risks, since the fields are not used to induce any particular behavior by the recipient application.

The format does not contain executable code, scripts, or macros. The format contains offset values and count values, which can trigger segmentation faults in applications.

The image is not compressed, and the compression attribute is set to No Compression.

The format does not include encryption, or other forms of privacy protection. If needed, such would have to be provided externally.

The format includes optional MD5 digests for verifying the integrity of metadata and image data.


Interoperability considerations:
ACES Image Container files are scene-referred.
