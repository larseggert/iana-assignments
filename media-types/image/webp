Type name: image

Subtype name: wmf

Required parameters: None.

Optional parameters:

   DEFAULT_CHARSET: The character set intended when the CharacterSet
      enumeration (see the WMF specification) specifies
      DEFAULT_CHARSET.  The value of this parameter is a charset from
      the IANA "Character Sets" registry
      <http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets>.  When this
      parameter is not specified, DEFAULT_CHARSET has the following
      meaning in the WMF specification: "a character set based on the
      current system locale; for example, when the system locale is
      United States English, the default character set is
      ANSI_CHARSET" (which is Windows-1252, more or less).  That is,
      when not specified, the default character set is system
      dependent.  This optional parameter is new to this registration
      and may not enjoy widespread support for some time.  Therefore,
      EMF instead of WMF (or if necessary under the circumstances,
      embedded EMF within WMF) is a more sensible choice when text is
      present.

Encoding considerations: Binary.

Security considerations:

   The Windows Metafile format's security history is punctuated in
   2005-2006 with the disclosure of the Metafile Image Code Execution
   ("MICE") vulnerability.  MICE won the 2007 Pwnie Award for "Mass
   0wnage" and "Breaking the Internet".  The official Microsoft
   security bulletin describes that the flaw occurs because Windows
   Metafiles can set the SETABORTPROC value of the MetafileEscapes
   enumeration (accessible via the META_ESCAPE record), allowing for
   arbitrary code execution, i.e., "active content".

   Windows Metafiles can contain Enhanced Metafiles using the
   META_ESCAPE_ENHANCED_METAFILE record; thus, the security
   considerations of EMF apply to WMF.

   Windows Metafiles are historically very buggy.  As the original
   intent was to replicate Windows GDI calls, flaws in GDI, or in a
   display or printer driver implementing the backend to GDI, could
   be exploitable.  WMF implementations not backed by Windows GDI
   have different risks: namely, while a malicious WMF author may not
   consider the non-Windows GDI implementation as a primary target,
   WMF has many "corner case" records for which an implementation's
   processing may not have received the same level of scrutiny as the
   Windows implementation.  "Fuzzing" the implementation is
   appropriate.

   As a "basic" image format, the image/wmf media type does not
   employ executable content and provides no facilities for privacy
   or integrity.

Interoperability considerations:

   Windows Metafile is the original 16-bit metafile format; it was
   released in 1990 at what some computer historians might consider
   the "zenith" of the desktop publishing revolution.  Accordingly,
   there is a large body of free and commercially available clip art
   that is still in use, either independently or embedded in
   productivity documents (word processing documents, desktop
   publishing documents, slideshows, presentations, spreadsheets, and
   workbooks).  For example, references to WMF content appear (non-
   normatively) in Office Open XML.  To say that support for this
   format is necessary for interoperability would not be an
   understatement.

   Accommodations for comments or arbitrary data storage in Windows
   Metafiles are virtually non-existent.  However, Windows Metafiles
   can contain Enhanced Metafiles using the
   META_ESCAPE_ENHANCED_METAFILE record, so an implementation that
   handles Windows Metafiles is also expected to handle enhanced
   metafile content.  Windows Metafiles can store and output text
   strings (see META_TEXTOUT and META_EXTTEXTOUT records), but the
   encodings of the strings may be ambiguous.  Unicode encodings are
   not possible without the DEFAULT_CHARSET parameter defined in this
   registration.

   The previously unregistered type image/x-wmf is also in wide use.
   Accordingly, it is registered as a deprecated alias.
