Media type name: model

Media subtype name: mtl

Required parameters: N/A

Optional parameters: N/A

Encoding considerations: 8bit

Security considerations: This media type does not allow for any kind 
   of executable content. As such, the data elements currently 
   defined in the MTL specification alone does not create security 
   risks beyond the information disclosed. This format does not 
   itself provided any form of integrity or confidentiality 
   protection, so if such protection is needed it must be done 
   externally, e.g., with HTTPs.

Interoperability considerations: The Material Library (MTL) file is a
   complement to the OBJ file. The MTL file establishes color 
   information for a 3D geometry described in an OBJ file. The file 
   format is well-established and well-adopted data format for 
   exchange of 3D models between different software systems.

   There are no known interoperability issues.

Published specification: Wavefront Technologies. 1992. Object Files 
   (.obj), Advanced Visualizer

Applications which use this media: This media type is used in 
   conjunction with the OBJ file format (n.b., the file can be 
   independent of OBJ files and is human readable). The data consists
   materials instructions for geometry found in an OBJ dataset.

   The applications that use (or would use) the media type model/mtl 
   are those that display, create, edit, import, or export 3D model 
   content using the OBJ standard. A short list of the applications 
   include:

   Blender (Open source, runs on Windows, Macintosh, Linux)
   Cura (Ultimate BV, runs on Windows, Macintosh, Linux)
   Geomagic Wrap (3DSystems, runs on Windows)
   GrabCAD (browser-based)
   *Instant Reality (Fraunhofer, runs on Windows, Macintosh, Linux)
   Maya (Autodesk, runs on Windows, Macintosh)
   Mimics (Materialise, runs on Windows)
   3D Slicer (Open source, runs on Windows, Macintosh, Linux)
   Simplify3D (Simplify3D, runs on Windows, Macintosh, Linux)

Fragment identifier considerations: Fragment identifiers must be 
   encoded in utf-8.

Restrictions on usage: N/A

Additional information:

   1. Deprecated alias names for this type: N/A
   2. Magic number(s): N/A
   3. File extension(s): mtl
   4. Macintosh file type code: N/A
   5. Object Identifiers: N/A

General Comments: This media type is intended to be referenced in 
   Supplement 208 (DICOM Encapsulation of OBJ Models for 3D 
   Manufacturing and Virtual RealityDICOM Encapsulation of OBJ Models 
   for 3D Manufacturing and Virtual Reality) of the DICOM standard. 
   The intent is for this supplement is to be published in the 
   January 2020 update of the standard.
