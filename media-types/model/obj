Media type name: model

Media subtype name: obj

Required parameters: N/A

Optional parameters: N/A

Encoding considerations: 8bit

Security considerations: This media type does not allow for any kind 
   of executable content. As such, the data elements currently 
   defined in the OBJ specification alone do not create security 
   risks beyond the information disclosed.

   This format does not itself provided any form of integrity or
   confidentiality protection, so if such protection is needed it 
   must be done externally, e.g., with HTTPs.

Interoperability considerations: The OBJ file format is 
   well-established and well-adopted data format for exchange of 3D 
   models between different software systems. OBJ expands beyond 
   other file formats by including color/texture information.

   OBJ is commonly utilized by modern software systems for 3D 
   modeling, animation, 3D printing, and extended reality platforms.

Published specification: Wavefront Technologies. 1992. Object Files 
   (.obj), Advanced Visualizer.

Applications which use this media: This media type is used to 
   exchange 3D models intended for visualization, 3D printing, and 
   extended reality applications. The data consists of sets of 
   adjacent triangles that together define a tessellated geometric 
   surface.

   The applications that use (or would use) the media type model/obj 
   are those that display, create, edit, import, or export 3D model 
   content using the OBJ standard. A short list of the applications 
   include:

   Blender (Open source, runs on Windows, Macintosh, Linux)
   Cura (Ultimate BV, runs on Windows, Macintosh, Linux)
   Geomagic Wrap (3DSystems, runs on Windows)
   GrabCAD (browser-based)
   *Instant Reality (Fraunhofer, runs on Windows, Macintosh, Linux)
   Maya (Autodesk, runs on Windows, Macintosh)
   Mimics (Materialise, runs on Windows)
   3D Slicer (Open source, runs on Windows, Macintosh, Linux)
   Simplify3D (Simplify3D, runs on Windows, Macintosh, Linux)

Fragment identifier considerations: Fragment identifiers must be 
   encoded in utf-8.

Restrictions on usage: N/A

Additional information:

   1. Deprecated alias names for this type: N/A
   2. Magic number(s): N/A
   3. File extension(s): obj
   4. Macintosh file type code: N/A
   5. Object Identifiers: N/A

General Comments: This media type is intended to be referenced in 
   Supplement 208 (DICOM Encapsulation of OBJ Models for 3D 
   Manufacturing and Virtual Reality) of the DICOM standard. The 
   intent is for this supplement is to be published in the January 
   2020 update of the standard.
