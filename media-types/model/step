Media type name: model

Media subtype name: step

Required parameters: none

Optional parameters: none

Encoding considerations: binary

Security considerations: This media type does not allow for any kind 
   of executable or active content and is nonextensible. As such, the
   data elements currently defined in ISO 10303-21 do not in 
   themselves create security risks beyond the information disclosed,
   since the elements are not used to induce any behavior by the 
   recipient software application.

   This media type does not employ compression.

Interoperability considerations: The semantics is given by an EXPRESS 
   schema which is referenced in the header section of an exchange 
   file.

Published specification: The specification is published in various 
   parts of the ISO 10303 series. The most recent specification is 
   available from the ISO website or from National standardization 
   bodies for a nominal fee.

Applications which use this media: Applications that display, create, 
   edit, import, or export ISO 10303 product data models, which are 
   encoded in the exchange syntax defined in ISO 10303-21, use this 
   media type. While the ISO 10303-21 syntax is also used in 
   application/p21, model/step provides assurance that the model 
   represented is a STEP product data model.

Fragment identifier considerations: none

Restrictions on usage: none
