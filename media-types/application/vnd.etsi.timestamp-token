MIME subtype name : Vendor Tree - vnd.etsi.timestamp-token

Required parameters : None

Optional parameters : None

Encoding considerations : binary

Security considerations :
This media type consists of a DER-encoded TimeStampToken as specified
in RFC 3161; all the security considerations specified in section 4
of that document apply to this media type.

No active or executable content is present.

The token only contains a hash of the data being time-stamped so under
normal circumstances no confidentiality protection is needed. Integrity
of the data is guaranteed because time-stamp token are electronically
signed by a Time Stamping Authority.

It should be noted that the hash refers to data objects carried in ASiC
containers. These may contain malicious code and hence unless the source
is trusted the usual protection against malware and viruses should be
applied.
