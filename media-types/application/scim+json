Type name:  application

Subtype name:  scim+json

Required parameters:  none

Optional parameters:  none

Encoding considerations:  8bit

Security considerations:  See Section 7 of RFC-ietf-scim-api-19

Interoperability considerations:  The "application/scim+json" media
   type is intended to identify JSON structure data that conforms to
   the SCIM protocol and schema specifications.  Older versions of
   SCIM are known to informally use "application/json".

Published specification:  RFC-ietf-scim-api-19

Applications that use this media type:  It is expected that
   applications that use this type may be special purpose
   applications intended for inter-domain provisioning.  Clients may
   also be applications (e.g., mobile applications) that need to use
   SCIM for self-registration of user accounts.  SCIM services may be
   offered by web applications that offer support for standards based
   provisioning or may be a dedicated SCIM service provider such as a
   "cloud directory".  Content may be treated as equivalent to
   "application/json" type for the purpose of displaying in web
   browsers.

Additional information:

      Magic number(s):

      File extension(s): .scim .scm

      Macintosh file type code(s):

Person & email address to contact for further information:  SCIM
   mailing list "<scim&ietf.org>"

Intended usage:  COMMON* (see restrictions)

Restrictions on usage:  For most client types, it is sufficient to
   recognize the content as equivalent to "application/json".
   Applications intending to use SCIM protocol SHOULD use the
   application/scim+json media type.
