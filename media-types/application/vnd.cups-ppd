MIME media type name : Application

MIME subtype name : Vendor Tree - vnd.cups-ppd

Required parameters : None

Optional parameters :
None

Encoding considerations : 8bit
This media type may require encoding on transports not capable of 
handling 8 bit text.

Security considerations :
PPD files contain printer-specific commands which could cause incorrect 
printing behavior. See section 4.5.2 of RFC 2046 for examples.

The base PPD specification provides a file inclusion facility which is a 
potential security hole; CUPS does not support it for that reason.


Interoperability considerations :
The PPD specification requires all applications to support CR, LF, and 
CR LF line endings, and has a maximum line length of 255 characters, so 
this file format is extremely portable across platforms.

CUPS also supports PPD files compressed using gzip (RFC 1952), which is 
also cross-platform.
