Media type name: application

Media subtype name: vnd.cyclonedx+json

Required parameters: N/A

Optional parameters:

   version

      The version parameter refers to the CycloneDX specification 
      version in use.

      version = 1*DIGIT "." 1*DIGIT

Encoding considerations: binary

   This media type has all of the same encoding considerations of 
   application/json as described in [RFC8259].

Security considerations: This media type has all of the same security
   considerations of application/json as described in [RFC8259].

   Additional care should be taken when processing the attachment 
   elements diff, license element text and swid element text. 
   Although the contents should be text, an application processing 
   them should not assume the encoded content is text. Especially if 
   using an external application or system to view or further process
   the contents of these elements.

   Depending on the operational context of the device or software 
   being described by the SBOM there may be additional security 
   requirements. These may include, but are not limited to, 
   encryption at rest, encryption in transit and restrictions on the 
   transmission of the SBOM to 3rd parties. These additional 
   requirements are considered out of scope for the specification. 
   And will typically be enforced by contract or copyright terms.

Interoperability considerations: This media type has the same 
   interoperability considerations of application/json as described 
   in [RFC8259].

Published specification: The specification can be found on the 
   CycloneDX website, https://cyclonedx.org/

   The current JSON schema version, 1.2, can be found at 
   https://github.com/CycloneDX/specification/blob/605e262/schema/bom-1.2.schema.json

Applications which use this media: This media type is used to specify 
   a software bill of materials.

   It will be used by tools that produce SBOMs either during the 
   software build process or as a result of software composition 
   analysis.

   It will also be used by tools that consume SBOMs for software 
   supply chain, component, supplier, license and vulnerability 
   analysis.

Fragment identifier considerations: N/A

Restrictions on usage: N/A

Additional information:

   1. Deprecated alias names for this type: N/A
   2. Magic number(s): N/A
   3. File extension(s): .json
