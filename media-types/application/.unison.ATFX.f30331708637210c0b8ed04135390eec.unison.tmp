Required parameters : N/A

Encoding considerations : 8bit, UTF-8

Security considerations :
ATFX is an import and export format for test data. As an XML format, ATFX inherits all of the security considerations of XML specified in RFC 3023. Executable content is not allowed by the format. The format does not itself provide integrity or privacy protection. The format allows to include other ATFX files via the XInclude-tag. Included files must adhere to the ATFX schema and specifications as well. The format contains access control information for the data included in the file. The access control information is imported into data bases and then controls access to the imported data via the ODS API. Appropriate care should be taken when constructing, interpreting, and transporting this material.
