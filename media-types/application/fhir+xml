Security considerations:
The content that may be carried in the FHIR media type includes Protected Health Information, information that identifies individuals (including genetic sequences), executable code, XHTML and billing and claiming information. Exchanging this kind of information carries many kinds of security risks to the systems that handle, store and administer the media. Further details are available at http://hl7.org/fhir/security.html. As an XML-based type, this media type inherits the security considerations of XML- see RFC 7303 section 10.

Interoperability considerations:
FHIR is an interoperability format defined for use across the healthcare system. However the healthcare system itself has wide variations in information and business processes across jurisdiction, domain, institution type, and clinical context. For this reason, it should never be assumed that 2 applications that implement FHIR in a conformant fashion will interoperate with each other. FHIR includes an extensive meta-language for dealing with this variability, and the applicable conformance statements or implementation guides should be consulted (see http://hl7.org/fhir/profiling.html)

Published specification:
http://hl7.org/fhir

Many 100s of applications across healthcare, including EHRs, patient registries, Clinical research applications, Terminology servers
