Media type name: application

Media subtype name: vnd.ipld.raw

Required parameters: N/A

Optional parameters: N/A

Encoding considerations: binary

Security considerations: The media type inherits the security 
   considerations for application/octet-stream: contains no 
   executable code, provides no means for integrity protection or 
   data confidentiality.

   When used in IPFS context, it is strongly recommended verifying 
   block data integrity based on expected CID digest
   <https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/glossary/#cid>

Interoperability considerations: N/A

Published specification: 

   Raw block is an opaque array of bytes:
   <https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/glossary/#block>
   <https://ipld.io/glossary/#block>

Applications which use this media: IPFS <https://ipfs.io> uses raw 
   blocks in data stores, HTTP gateways 
   <https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/glossary#gateway>, inside of CAR 
   archives <https://ipld.io/specs/transport/car/carv1/>, and during 
   p2p bitswap exchanges 
   <https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/glossary#bitswap>

Fragment identifier considerations: N/A

Restrictions on usage: N/A
