Media type name: application
Media subtype name: vnd.3gpp.mcdata-signalling

Required parameters: none

Optional parameters:
   "charset" the parameter has identical semantics to the charset 
   parameter of the "application/xml" media type as specified in 
   section 9.1 of IETF RFC 7303.

Encoding considerations: binary

Security considerations: General mechanisms for privacy and integrity 
   protection of protocol parameters exist. Those mechanisms as well 
   as authentication and further security mechanisms are described in 
   3GPP TS 24.229.

   Security mechanisms specific to this MIME type are dependent upon 
   the business and trust relationship between the mission critical 
   data communications (MCData) operator and the SIP carrier 
   operator. MCData operators may wish to encrypt and integrity 
   protect the content transported by this MIME type indepedently of 
   mechanisms provided by the transport layer. Such mechanisms are 
   being specified in Rel-14 by 3GPP SA3. Security mechanisms applied 
   to MCData signalling content is point-to-point (UE to server, 
   server to server, server to UE).

   The information transported in this media type does not include 
   active or executable content.

   This media type does not include provisions for directives that 
   institute actions on a recipient's files or other resources.

   This media type does not include provisions for directives that 
   institute actions that, while not directly harmful to the 
   recipient, may result in disclosure of information that either 
   facilitates a subsequent attack or else violates a recipient's 
   privacy in any way.

   This media type does not employ compression.

Interoperability considerations: The content transported within this 
   MIME type needs to be interpreted by a server as specific 
   decisions are made based on the signalling content (e.g. store 
   disposition history). The final destination point of the content 
   is the terminating UE. Each UE and server that handles the content 
   transported using this MIME type shall understand the definition 
   of the messages and protocol elements as defined in 3GPP TS 2
   4.282. Any messages and protocol elements not defined by 3GPP TS 
   24.282 shall be ignored by the recipient UE or server.

Published specification: 3GPP TS 24.282 v14.3.0, 
   http://www.3gpp.org/ftp//Specs/archive/24_series/24.282/

Applications which use this media: Applications supporting the 
   mission critical data communications procedures as described in 
   the published specification. This MIME type shall contain 
   signalling content that is related to the payload that is 
   delivered to a terminating user or an application of the 
   terminating user.

Fragment identifier considerations: The handling in section 5 of IETF 
   RFC 7303 applies.
