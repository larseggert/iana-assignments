MIME media type name: Application

MIME subtype name: Vendor Tree - vnd.emclient.accessrequest+xml

Required parameters: none

Optional parameters:

   version - in the X.Y notation where X specifies major version 
      change and Y specifies minor version change. Applications 
      supporting this MIME type should not try to process the content 
      unless the major version number is recognized by the particular 
      implementation.

Encoding considerations: This media type MAY be encoded as
   appropriate for the charset and the capabilities of the underlying
   MIME transport. For 7-bit transports, data in either UTF-8 or
   UTF-16 MUST be encoded in quoted-printable or base64. For 8-bit
   clean transport (e.g., 8BITMIME[RFC1652] ESMTP or NNTP[RFC0977]),
   UTF-8 is not encoded, but the UTF-16 family MUST be encoded in
   base64. For binary clean transports (e.g., HTTP[RFC2616]), no
   content-transfer-encoding is necessary.

Security considerations: The type exists to provide a limited and 
   safe subset of operations to media authors, but the full spectrum 
   of security issues associated with this type has not been 
   completely assessed.

   Explicit actions based on the content should be done only after 
   confirmation by the recepient. Embedding inside S/MIME container 
   with digital signature is recommended.

   See RFC 3023, section 10 for a more complete analysis of XML 
   related security issues.

Interoperability considerations: There are no special known 
   interoperability issues, but the full spectrum of interoperability 
   issues associated with this type has not been completely
   assessed.
