Media type name: application

Media subtype name: stratum

Required parameters: N/A

Optional parameters: N/A

Encoding considerations: binary

The format is just JSON-RPC, but each command is seperated with \n (or \r\n, as long as the line ends with \n).

Security considerations: 

(1) Whether the media type contains active or executable content: The media type itself doesn't contain data that can be executed. It is only a format that contains commands that will be responded to when send over TCP. Downloading and accidently double clicking it will have no effect.

(2) Whether the information contained in the media type needs privacy or integrity services: No privacy. The format is mostly used to query public information. If people want more protection, they should use SSL/TLS.

(3) If the media type uses an existing format: It is based on JSON, so: See RFC 8259, Section 12.

(4) Link(s) that must be referenced in order to properly interpret the type:  https://github.com/ben221199/bips/blob/add-bip40/bip-0040.mediawiki

Interoperability considerations: Also see RFC 8259.

Published specification: https://github.com/ben221199/bips/blob/add-bip40/bip-0040.mediawiki (But will be merged into the main repository.)
