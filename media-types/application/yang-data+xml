Required parameters:  none

Optional parameters:  none

Encoding considerations:  8-bit
	Each conceptual YANG data node is encoded according to the
	XML Encoding Rules and Canonical Format for the specific
	YANG data node type defined in [RFC7950].

Security considerations:  Security considerations related
	to the generation and consumption of RESTCONF messages
	are discussed in Section NN of [RFC-ietf-netconf-restconf-18].
	Additional security considerations are specific to the
	semantics of particular YANG data models. Each YANG module
	is expected to specify security considerations for the
	YANG data defined in that module.

Interoperability considerations: [RFC-ietf-netconf-restconf-18] specifies the
	format of conforming messages and the interpretation
	thereof.

Published specification:  [RFC-ietf-netconf-restconf-18]

Applications that use this media type: Instance document
	data parsers used within a protocol or automation tool
	that utilize YANG defined data structures.
	
Fragment identifier considerations: Fragment identifiers for
	this type are not defined.  All YANG data nodes are
	accessible as resources using the path in the request URI.
