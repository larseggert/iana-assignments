Encoding considerations: binary

   Character encodings may be specified within an SBE message schema.

Security considerations: Simple Binary Encoding is strictly a 
   presentation layer protocol, and makes no claim to safety at 
   session or application layers. Data consists of a stream of octets
   of either fixed or variable length. Users must take care to avoid 
   buffer overruns and should verify that data conforms to specified 
   data types. This format is not intended for active context, such 
   as executable code.

Interoperability considerations: Implementers may demonstrate 
   interoperability with others by publishing results of 
   fix-sbe-conformance test suite, published as open source by FIX 
   Trading Community.

Published specification: Simple Binary Encoding standards are 
   published by FIX Trading Community at 
   https://www.fixtrading.org/standards/sbe/ and 
   https://github.com/FIXTradingCommunity/fix-simple-binary-encoding

Applications which use this media: Simple Binary Encoding was
