(see RFC-iab-xml2rfc-04, Section 8.1)

Type name:  application

Subtype name:  rfc+xml

Required parameters:  There are no required parameters.

Optional parameters:  "charset": This parameter has identical
   semantics to the charset parameter of the "application/xml" Media
   Type specified in Section 9.1 of [RFC7303].

Encoding considerations:  Identical to those of "application/xml" as
   described in Section 9.1 of [RFC7303].

Security considerations:  As defined in Section 7 of RFC-iab-xml2rfc-04.  
   In addition, as this Media Type uses the "+xml" convention, it 
	inherits the security considerations described in Section 10 of 
	[RFC7303].

Interoperability considerations:  Different implementations of this
   format have had interoperability issues.  It is not expected that
   publication of this application will cause those implementations
   to be fixed.

Published specification:  RFC-iab-xml2rfc-04.

Applications that use this Media Type:  Applications that transform
   xml2rfc to output representations such as plain text or HTML, plus
   additional analysis tools.

Fragment identifier considerations:  The "anchor" attribute is used
   for assigning document-wide unique identifiers that can be used as
   shorthand pointers, as described in "XPointer Framework", W3C 
	Recommendation REC-xptr-framework-20030325, March 2003, 
	<http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-xptr-framework-20030325/>.
