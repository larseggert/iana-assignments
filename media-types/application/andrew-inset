MIME subtype name: andrew-inset

Required parameters: NONE

Optional parameters: NONE

Encoding considerations:  None required.  The Andrew data stream was
designed to be 7-bit SMTP safe.

Security considerations:  The Andrew data stream is open-ended in the
sense that it can be expanded by the definition of new "insets".  If
care is not taken in the definition of such insets and their data
stream, it might be possible to send "Trojan horses" through the mail. 
Andrew users should bear this in mind when they install new insets, and
should be wary of installing insets from unreliable sources.  Insets
cannot be installed via mail, however, so as long as care is taken in
the installation of insets, nothing that comes through the mail can
cause a security problem.
