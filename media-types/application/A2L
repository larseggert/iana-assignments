MIME media type name : Application

MIME subtype name : Standards Tree - A2L

Required parameters : N/A

Optional parameters :
N/A

Encoding considerations: binary (UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32)


Security considerations :
A2L files are descriptions of electronic control units (ECUs). Any security considerations which apply to Text/Plain also apply to A2L. The format is partially a keyword-value format and partially defined via a BNF notation, which does not allow to express executable content that can modify files or other resources on the host system. Since ECU files do not themselves contain confidentially or integrity mechanisms, appropriate protections must be applied externally. 

Interoperability considerations :


Published specification :
ASAM MCD-2 MC (ASAP2)

Applications which use this media :
The A2L format is used in applications, which are involved in the creation, processing, storage and exchange of measurements data and calibratable parameters of automotive ECUs. Especially applications for the ECU development and test phases are in focus of this format. Such applications are:
- calibration systems (aka application systems)
- editors
- checkers
- run-time systems
- ECU interface development and diagnostic (e.g. XCP) tools
- code generators
- rapid control prototyping tools
- data loggers

Additional information :

1. Magic number(s) : N/A
2. File extension(s) : a2l
3. Macintosh file type code : N/A
4. Object Identifiers: N/A
