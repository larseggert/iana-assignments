Type name: application

Subtype name: vnd.espass-espass+zip 

Required parameters: N/A

Optional parameters: N/A

Encoding considerations: binary

Security considerations: This media type contains an electronic 
   smartpass, referred to as a "pass". The overall format is that of 
   a ZIP file, and as such inherits   the security considerations of 
   the application/zip media type.

   The ZIP file consists of a main.json file and a number of 
   associated assets in various image formats that have to be parsed 
   in order to be used and/or displayed. Therefore the security 
   considerations of application/json and whatever image formats are 
   used also apply to pass objects.

   The main.json file specifies things like the type of pass, time,
   location, barcode, contract information, and so on. It does not 
   contain any executable content.

   The binary data in a pass should be treated potentially harmful and
   ideally be parsed in isolation so that an exploit when parsing 
   images from one pass can not access other passes. The same goes 
   for parsing the main.json file.

   The information contained in the pass can be sensitive and private 
   and should not be exposed without consent of the user. There will 
   be the option for protection of integrity by hashes published on a 
   blockchain and/or IPNS - but this part of the espass specification 
   is incomplete at the time of this registration.

   The espass format does not itself provide confidentiality 
   protection - this must be provided externally.
