Media type name: application

Media subtype name: vnd.veritone.aion+json

Required parameters: N/A

Optional parameters: N/A

Encoding considerations: binary. 8-bit files must be UTF-8 encoded 
   (RFC 8259, Section 8.1)

Security considerations: Inherits JSON security considerations from 
   RFC 8259, Section 12.

   The standard format does not contain active or executable content,
   links to external material, or employ compression. However, the 
   standard can be extended through the use of vendor or structured 
   data sections, whose content is arbitrary.

   May contain personally identifiable information (PII) about either 
   a digital asset or the subject matter of that asset. This may 
   include information about the author, location, date, and time the
   digital asset was created or modified, as well as identifying 
   information about the subject matter of the asset derived from 
   automated analysis of video, audio, image, and/or text, including 
   names, ages, ethnicities, license plates, behavior, statistics, 
   summaries, etc.

   Protection of PII is external to the file format. Transmission 
   should use SSL/TLS, and storage should be on a secure service or 
   device and/or use encryption. Public versions (e.g. fulfillment of
   Freedom of Information Act requests) should be redacted before 
   release.
