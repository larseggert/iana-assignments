Encoding considerations: binary

Security considerations: The media type does not contain active or executable content.

The information contained in the media type needs privacy and integrity services applied to the mechanism used to transport the payload.

In the specification where this media-type is applied, the CBOR content is transported using CoAP messaging as specified in [RFC7252] ensuring privacy and authenticity using COSE_Encrypt0 as specified in [RFC9052] and [RFC9053].

Furthermore, the security considerations in Section 10 of [RFC8949] shall be regarded.

Interoperability considerations: The OMS-Group e. V. is a community of interest of associations. The mission of the OMS organization is to specify interoperability of solutions within the smart metering industry. Therefore, OMS publishes requirements open and vendor independent specifications and conformance test specifications for smart metering systems with the possibility for Certification of smart meters that passes conformance tests. The specification and usage of the media type will eventually be part of the conformity test.

Published specification: N/A
