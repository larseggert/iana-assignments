MIME media type name: Application

MIME subtype name: Vendor Tree - vnd.etsi.overload-control-policy-dataset+xml

Required parameters: None

Optional parameters: None

Encoding considerations: 8bit
This media type may require encoding on transports not capable of handling 8 bit
text.

Security considerations:
This schema is used to generate load control requests between servers in
telecommunications networks. Such a function is a potential vector of DoS
attacks and, as such, should be treated with the same security considerations
that are required for any control plane signalling in telecoms networks (e.g.
SIP). Within a trusted network environment, no additional security is required,
but signalling relationships with untrusted networks, or where the signalling
traverses untrusted networks, authentication of endpoints and data integrity is
required. There is no active or executable content.

Interoperability considerations:
Interoperability is assessed not to be an issue as the MIME type is in the
vendor tree. XML definitions are assessed to solve different character set and
byte ordering issues. Message format does have version number and backwards
compatibility will be preserved in the possible format evolution.


Published specification:
ETSI ES 283 039-2 v3 available at
http://pda.etsi.org/pda/queryform.asp

Applications which use this media:
Applications implementing GOCAP for processing overload control will use this
schema to encode overload control information in GOCAP messages. The control
messages may be used to modify the rate at which neighbours send service
requests towards a particular server.


Additional information:

1. Magic number(s): None
2. File extension(s): None
3. Macintosh file type code: None
4. Object Identifiers: None

Encoding considerations: UTF-8 is sufficient as very little text in conformant
XML documents is left to the choice of the end user.
Most text elements are defined in the GOCAP spec, or will be specified in
derived specifications and profiles. If a derived
specification requires use of international characters (e.g. for
internationalised domain names) that specification will have to
define a suitable mapping (e.g. as in RFC3490).
