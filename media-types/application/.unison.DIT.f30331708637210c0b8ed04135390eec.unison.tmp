Required parameters : N/A

Optional parameters :
N/A

Encoding considerations : 8bit, UTF-8


Security considerations :
A DIT file is a text file providing a set of messages in one specific
language. The texts involved are user defined messages, errors,
informational messages, warnings as well as general texts, which are
intended for the user.

Any security considerations which apply to Text/Plain also apply to DIT. The 
format is defined via a BNF notation, which does not allow the expression of
executable content that can modify files or other resources on the host
system.

DIT files do not provide integrity or confidentiality protection. If such
protections are needed they must be provided externally.

Interoperability considerations :


Published specification :
ASAM GDI

Applications which use this media :
The DIT format is used in automation system applications, especially in the area of test beds for automotive systems. Typical domains are chassis dynamometers, engine dynamometers, emission test benches, transmission test beds and fluid filling stations.
