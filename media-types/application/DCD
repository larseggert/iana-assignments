MIME media type name : Application

MIME subtype name : Standards Tree - DCD

Required parameters : N/A

Optional parameters : N/A

Encoding considerations : 7bit

Security considerations :
Any security considerations which apply to Text/Plain also apply to DCD. The format does not allow to express executable content that can modify files or other resources on the host system. However, a DCD file specifies how a host system communicates with test equipment. Since DCD files do not themselves contain confidentiality or integrity mechanisms, appropriate protections must be applied externally.

Interoperability considerations :

Published specification : ASAM GDI

Applications which use this media :
The DCD format is used in automation system applications, especially 
in the area of test beds for automotive systems. Typical domains are 
chassis dynamometers, engine dynamometers, emission test benches, 
transmission test beds and fluid filling stations.

Additional information :
1. Magic number(s) : N/A
2. File extension(s) : dcd
3. Macintosh file type code : N/A
4. Object Identifiers: N/A
