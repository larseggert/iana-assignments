The Plucker document format supports a single-file multi-page (in the
Web sense of 'page') hyperlinked information structure containing both
'rich' text and images. Links must be internal to the document, though
external links, in standard URL form, may be included and displayed,
but not followed. Images may either be embedded in a text page, as
with HTML, or be included as separate stand-alone pages.
