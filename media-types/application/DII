Security considerations :
A DII file is a text file for the user-interface of ASAM GDI drivers containing strings for messages, errors and general-purpose texts, which are intended for the user.

Any security considerations which apply to Text/Plain also apply to DII. The format is defined via a BNF notation, which does not allow the expression of executable content that can modify files or other resources on the host system.

DII files do no provide integrity or confidentiality protection. If such protections are needed they must be provided externally.
