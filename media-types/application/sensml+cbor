Type name: application

Subtype name: sensml+cbor

Required parameters: none

Optional parameters: none

Encoding considerations: Must be encoded as using RFC 8949.  See RFC 8428 for details.

Security considerations: See Section 13 of RFC 8428.

Interoperability considerations: Applications MUST ignore any key-
value pairs that they do not understand unless the key ends with the
"_" character, in which case an error MUST be generated.  This allows
backwards-compatible extensions to this specification.  The "bver"
field can be used to ensure the receiver supports a minimal level of
functionality needed by the creator of the CBOR object.

Published specification: RFC 8428

Applications that use this media type: The type is used by systems
