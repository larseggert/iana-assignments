MIME media type name : Application

MIME subtype name : Personal Tree - prs.rdf-xml-crypt

Required parameters :


Optional parameters :
version - a non-negative integer written in canonical (i.e. no leading
zeroes) decimal form. The version of application/prs.rdf-xml-crypt
currently emitted by RDF-Crypt is 0. Future versions may be defined in
future versions of RDF-Crypt. If the version number is omitted, no
default is assumed.


Encoding considerations : 7bit


Security considerations :

The media type does not contain executable content.

The media type uses RSA encryption and cipher-block chaining with OAEP,
a combination that has a reasonably good track-record for security. It
should certainly offer significant security improvements over other
existing RDF serialisation including RDF/XML (application/rdf+xml) and
Turtle which do not include any built-in encryption.

However, as with any file format, if the payload data is of a
particularly sensitive nature, people may wish to consider wrapping the
file in additional layers of security.

The security concerns in RFC 3870 (application/rdf+xml Media Type
Registration) should also be considered by implementors.

Interoperability considerations :



Published specification :
The documentation for the RDF::Crypt Perl library specifies the format
in some detail. <http://search.cpan.org/dist/RDF-Crypt/>

Applications which use this media :
The RDF::Crypt Perl library
