Media type name: application

Media subtype name: 3gpp-mbs-object-manifest+json

Required parameters: version (see clause E.3.2 of 3GPP TS 26.517).

Optional parameters: N/A

Encoding considerations: binary

This is a JSON document, and the encoding considerations are the same as for media type application/json defined in IETF RFC 8259.

Security considerations: This media format is used to describe a set of objects to the MBS Transport Function to be transmitted in an MBS Distribution Session as part of an MBS User Service. This format is highly susceptible to manipulation or spoofing for attacks designed to affect the set of objects ingested by the MBSTF and transmitted to receivers. Both integrity protection and source authentication are recommended to prevent misleading of the receiver.

Interoperability considerations: The specification defines a platform-independent manifest document format, and it is intended that wide interoperability can be achieved.

Published specification: 3GPP TS 26.517 clause D.1

Applications which use this media: 3GPP MBS-based applications and services

Fragment identifier considerations: The provisions of RFC 6901 (JSON Pointer) apply.

Additional information:

1. Deprecated alias names for this type: None
2. Magic number(s): None
