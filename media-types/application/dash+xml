MIME media type name : Application

MIME subtype name : Standards Tree - dash+xml

Required parameters : none

Optional parameters :
The ‘profiles’ parameter as documented in Annex C.3.1 in this part of 
ISO/IEC 23009. The 'profiles' parameter is an optional parameter that 
indicates one or more profiles to which the file claims conformance. The 
contents of this attribute shall conform to either the pro-simple or 
pro-fancy productions of RFC6381, Section 4.5. The profile identifiers 
reported in the MIME type parameter should match identically the 
profiles reported in the profiles attribute in the MPD
itself (see ISO/IEC 23009-1, clause 8).

Encoding considerations : 8bit


Security considerations :
The MPD is a Media Presentation Description and contains references to 
other resources. It is coded in XML, and there are risks that 
deliberately malformed XML could cause security issues. In addition, an 
MPD could be authored that causes receiving clients to access other 
resources; if widely distributed, this could be used to cause a 
denial-of-service attack.

The Media Presentation Description (MPD) format does not incorporate any 
active or executable content. However, other forms of material from 
outside sources can be referenced by an MPD, and this material could 
contain active or executable content. Such material is expected to be 
identified by its own MIME type, and the security considerations of that 
format should be taken into account.

If operating in an insecure environment and required by the 
content/service provider, elements and attributes of MPD may be 
encrypted to protect their confidentiality by using the syntax and 
processing rules specified in the W3C Recommendation “XML Encryption 
Syntax and Processing”.

If operating in an insecure environment and required by the 
content/service provider, the digital signing and verification 
procedures specified in the W3C Recommendation “XML Signature Syntax and 
Processing” may be used to protect data origin authenticity and 
integrity of the MPD
