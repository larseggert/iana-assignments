Coffeescript is a scripting language that is transcompiled to Javascript.
Then, the Javascript code is executed. As a result, all of the
security consideration for Javascript (see RFC 4329 section 5) are 
inherited.
Additionally, it is possible for the transcompilation process to
introduce its own errors, or for malicious code to be inserted into the
Coffeescript file prior to transcompilation. Coffeescript files usually 
appear asplain-text files prior to transcompilation. Therefore, such 
files typicallylack special security and permission restraints.
