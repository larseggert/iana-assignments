Security considerations :
The information present in this media format is used to configure the receiving 
application. Thus the usage of the format is vulnerable to attacks modifying or 
spoofing the content of this format. It is recommended to use source 
authentication and integrity protection. The information carried in the media 
format does not contain any privacy information such as passwords or keys. The 
information carried in the media format does not contain executable content. 
Content from other namespaces may be introduced into this media type by
