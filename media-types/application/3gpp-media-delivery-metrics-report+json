Media type name: application

Media subtype name: 3gpp-media-delivery-metrics-report+json

Required parameters: version (see clause E.2.2 of 3GPP TS 26.510).

Optional parameters: N/A

Encoding considerations: 8bit

This is a JSON document, and the encoding considerations are the same as for media type application/json defined in IETF RFC 8259.

Security considerations: This media format is used to report Quality of Experience metrics in 3GPP Media Delivery Systems such as the 5G Media Streaming (5GMS) System.

This format is highly susceptible to manipulation or spoofing for attacks designed to inject fake metrics. Both integrity protection and source authentication are recommended to prevent misleading of the recipient.

Interoperability considerations: The specification defines a platform-independent metrics reporting document format, and it is intended that wide interoperability can be achieved.

Published specification: 3GPP TS 26.510 clause 9.5.3.2 (if version needs to be provided, please see v19.0.0)

Applications which use this media: 3GPP 5GMS-based applications and services

Fragment identifier considerations: The provisions of RFC 6901 (JSON Pointer) apply.
