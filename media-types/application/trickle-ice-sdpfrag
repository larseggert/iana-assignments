Type name: application

Subtype name: trickle-ice-sdpfrag

Required parameters: None.

Optional parameters: None.

Encoding considerations: The media contents follow the same rules as 
   SDP, except as noted in RFC 8840.  The 
   media contents are text, with the grammar specified in Section 9.2.

   Although the initially defined content of a trickle-ice-sdpfrag
   body does only include ASCII characters, UTF-8 encoded content
   might be introduced via extension attributes.  The "charset"
   attribute may be used to signal the presence of other character
   sets in certain parts of a trickle-ice-sdpfrag body (see
   RFC8866).  Arbitrary binary content cannot 
   be directly represented in SDP or a trickle-ice-sdpfrag body.

Security considerations: See RFC-ietf-mmusic-rfc4566bis-37 and 
   RFC 8840

Interoperability considerations: See 
   RFC 8840

Published specification: See RFC 8840
