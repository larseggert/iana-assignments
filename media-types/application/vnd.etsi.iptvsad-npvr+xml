MIME media type name: Application

MIME subtype name: Vendor Tree - vnd.etsi.iptvsad-npvr+xml

Required parameters: none

Optional parameters: none

Encoding considerations: 8bit
This media type may require encoding on transports not capable of handling 8 bit
text.

Security considerations:
We do not foresee any additional security considerations over and
above the existing security considerations of SIP.
There is no active or executable content.
The ETSI TSs 183 xxx include only textual XML to Control Services.
If the Signalling and the XML media contained therein is security
protected then no explicit protection of the media privacy and
integrity is required.

Interoperability considerations:
Interoperability is assessed not to be an issue as the MIME type is in the
vendor tree. XML definitions are assessed to solve different character set and
byte ordering issues. Message format does have version number and backwards
compatibility will be preserved in the possible format evolution.
