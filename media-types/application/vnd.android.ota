Media type name: application

Media subtype name: vnd.android.ota

Required parameters: None

Optional parameters: None

Encoding considerations: binary

Security considerations: The ota file is a zip archive containing a 
   system update for the Android Operating System.  This file must be
   cryptographically signed, using the process set out at 
   https://source.android.com/devices/tech/ota/sign_builds .  The 
   signature can be verified via a tool, the latest code of which is 
   located at 
   https://android.googlesource.com/platform/build/+/refs/heads/master/tools/releasetools/check_ota_package_signature.py

   Since this is a zip file, it has all the same concerns a zip file 
   normally has. 

Interoperability considerations: There are no special 
   interoperability considerations. ota files are expected to have a 
   specific structure, and the Operating System updater expects and 
   confirms this prior to updating.

Published specification: While not an exhaustive specification, there
   is 
   https://source.android.com/devices/tech/ota/nonab/inside_packages.html

Applications which use this media: This is used by the Android 
   Operating System update mechanism.

   This file can be transferred via arbitrary file transfer 
   applications, and then invoked on an Android device to initialize 
   an operating system update without requiring the device to have 
   any sort of internet connectivity.

Fragment identifier considerations: None

Restrictions on usage: None

Additional information:

   1. Deprecated alias names for this type: None
   2. Magic number(s): 50 4b 03 04
   3. File extension(s): ota
   4. Macintosh file type code: None
   5. Object Identifiers: None

General Comments: The magic number is the ZIP magic number and 
   appears at the beginning of the file.

   OTA is an acronym for Over The Air, since the file format is 
   identical to what is used for OTA updates.
