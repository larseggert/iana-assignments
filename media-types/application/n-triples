Media type name: application

Media subtype name: n-triples

Required parameters: None

Optional parameters: None

Encoding considerations: 8bit
The syntax of N-Triples is expressed over code points in Unicode. The encoding is always UTF-8.
Unicode code points may also be expressed using an \uXXXX (U+0 to U+FFFF) or \UXXXXXXXX syntax (for U+10000 onwards) where X is a hexadecimal digit [0-9A-F].

Security considerations:
N-Triples is a general-purpose assertion language; applications may evaluate given data to infer more assertions or to dereference IRIs, invoking the security considerations of the scheme for that IRI. Note in particular, the privacy issues in RFC 7303 section 10 for HTTP IRIs. Data obtained from an inaccurate or malicious data source may lead to inaccurate or misleading conclusions, as well as the dereferencing of unintended IRIs. Care must be taken to align the trust in consulted resources with the sensitivity of the intended use of the data; inferences of potential medical treatments would likely require different trust than inferences for trip planning.

N-Triples is used to express arbitrary application data; security considerations will vary by domain of use. Security tools and protocols applicable to text (e.g. PGP encryption, cryptographuc hash validation, password-protected compression) may also be used on N-Triples documents. Integrity/privacy protocols must be imposed which reflect the sensitivity of the embedded information.

N-Triples can express data which is presented to the user, for example, RDF Schema labels. Application rendering strings retrieved from untrusted N-Triples documents must ensure that malicious strings may not be used to mislead the reader. The security considerations in the media type registration for XML (RFC 7303 section 10) provide additional guidance around the expression of arbitrary data and markup.

N-Triples uses IRIs as term identifiers. Applications interpreting data expressed in N-Triples should address the security issues of Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs) RFC 3987 Section 8, as well as Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax RFC 3986 Section 7.

Multiple IRIs may have the same appearance. Characters in different scripts may look similar (a Cyrillic "Ð¾" may appear similar to a Latin "o"). A character followed by combining characters may have the same visual representation as another character (LATIN SMALL LETTER E followed by COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT has the same visual representation as LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE). Any person or application that is writing or interpreting data in N-Triples must take care to use the IRI that matches the intended semantics, and avoid IRIs that make look similar. Further information about matching of similar characters can be found in Unicode Security Considerations <http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr36/> and Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs) [RFC3987] Section 8.
