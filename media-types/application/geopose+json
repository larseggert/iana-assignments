Media type name: application

Media subtype name: geopose+json

Required parameters: N/A

Optional parameters: version: The version parameter indicates the version of the OGC GeoPose specification. It can be used for content negotiation when dealing with clients and servers that support multiple GeoPose versions. Its range is the range of published GeoPose versions. As of this writing those are: 1.0 [OGC 21-056r11]. These and future version identifiers must follow the OGC patterns for versions [OGC 06-135]: the pattern includes the major and minor version numbers to the first decimal place only (e.g., 1.1). If this parameter is not specified by the client, the server is free to return any version it deems fit. If a client cannot or does not want to deal with version ambiguity, it should explicitly specify a version.

Encoding considerations: binary

Security considerations: Per their specification, application/geopose+json typed objects do not contain executable content. However, these objects are JSON-based, and thus they have all of the general security considerations presented in section 12 of [RFC 8259].

Interoperability considerations: Interoperable implementations of GeoPose require that all normative references in the Standard also be followed.

Published specification: [OGC 21-056r11] OGC GeoPose v1.0, 2023-09-08.

Applications which use this media: GeoPose is device, platform, and vendor-neutral and is supported by a wide range of geospatial applications. Any application which must encode or share the pose ((location and orientation) of an object referenced to the Earth or other body may use a GeoPose.

Fragment identifier considerations: N/A

Restrictions on usage: N/A

Additional information:

1. Deprecated alias names for this type: N/A
2. Magic number(s): N/A
3. File extension(s): N/A
4. Macintosh file type code: N/A
5. Object Identifiers: N/A

General Comments: OGC GeoPose v1.0 is a data model for exchanging the location and orientation of real or virtual geometric objects (“Poses”) within reference frames anchored to the earth's surface (“Geo”) or within other astronomical coordinate systems. This MediaType defines GeoPose encoded in JSON. This registration ensures an easy uptake in environments where JSON is the preferred encoding.
