MIME media type name: Application

MIME subtype name: Vendor Tree - vnd.etsi.mheg5

Required parameters: None

Optional parameters: None

Encoding considerations: binary


Security considerations:
Applications of this type are executed within a defined virtual machine
sandbox.
Applications may make use of an HTTP based server for both GET and PUT
facilities but the set of allowed target addresses is limited by an
access control list which can only be obtained from a secure source (a
broadcast TV network). Likewise, applications obtained from an HTTP
source (and text or image content if required) are signed and must be
confirmed using a secure certificate list before they are executed.
There is no facility within the sandbox API for applications to read
from or write to arbitrary files from the local file system.
Applications may be authenticated using public key cryptography. The
basic method by which this is achieved is by signing files with a
private key. The corresponding public key is then placed in the
broadcast carousel of any service from which access to the signed files
is required.
Different sources of content in a digital TV receiver have different
inherent levels of security. For example, a broadcast delivery mechanism
might be considered more secure than an Internet delivery mechanism.
Where applications need to send or receive data over the Internet
securely, secure connections can be established using the TLS (Transport
Layer Security) protocol as described in RFC2246. Certificates for
authentication of TLS servers shall be provided in the broadcast
carousel. TLS connections shall be requested by applications by using
the "https:" URI scheme in place of "http:".


Interoperability considerations:
