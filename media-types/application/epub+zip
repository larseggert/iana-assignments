MIME media type name : Application

MIME subtype name : Standards Tree - epub+zip

Required parameters : None.

Optional parameters : 
None.

Encoding considerations : binary


Security considerations : 
All processors that read EPUB OCF files should rigorously check the size and validity of data retrieved.

In addition, because of the various content types that can be embedded in EPUB OCF files, it is possible that application/epub+zip may describe content that has security implications beyond those described here. However, only in the case where the processor recognizes and processes the additional content, or where further processing of that content is dispatched to other processors, would security issues potentially arise. And in that case, they would fall outside the domain of this registration document.

Security considerations that apply to application/zip also apply to EPUB OCF files.

The EPUB 3.0.1 family specifies some intrinsic parts. They
may appear in EPUB publications (zip files).

EPUB Open Container Format (OCF) 3.0.1
container.xml
manifest.xml
metadata.xml
rights.xml
EPUB Media Overlays 3.0.1
media overlay documents
EPUB Publications 3.0.1
package documents
(application/oebps-package+xml)

None of them contain active or executable contents.

EPUB Open Container Format (OCF) 3.0.1 specifies files for
digital signature and encryption.

signatures.xml
encryption.xml

Although ZIP provides its own mechanism for encryption,
its use is not allowed by EPUB Open Container Format (OCF) 3.0.1.

Security considerations shown in RFC 7303 section 10 apply to
XML documents that appear within EPUB publications.


Interoperability considerations : 
Different EPUB reading systems exhibit slightly different behaviors. Reports of such differences are available, for example from http://epubtest.org/ .

Published specification : 
This media type registration is for the EPUB Open Container Format (OCF), as described by the EPUB Open Container Format (OCF) 3.0.1 specification located at http://www.idpf.org/epub/301/spec/epub-ocf.html .

The EPUB OCF 3.0 specification supersedes the Open Container Format 2.0.1 specification, which is located at http://www.idpf.org/doc_library/epub/OCF_2.0.1_draft.doc and which also uses the application/epub+zip media type.

Applications which use this media : 
This media type is in wide use for the distribution of ebooks in the EPUB format. The following list of applications is not exhaustive.

Adobe Digital Editions

Aldiko

Azardi

Apple iBooks

Barnes & Noble Nook

Calibre

Google Books

Ibis Reader

Kobo

MobiPocket reader

Sony Reader

Stanza

Fragment identifier considerations :
The IDPF maintains a registry of linking schemes at http://www.idpf.org/epub/linking/ . Some of these schemes define custom fragment identifiers that resolve to application/epub+zip and application/oebps-package+xml documents.

Restrictions on usage :
Universal support of this media type is expected.

Provisional registration? (standards tree only) :
This media type is intended to be permanent.
