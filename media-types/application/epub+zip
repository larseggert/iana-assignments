MIME media type name: application

MIME subtype name: epub+zip

Required parameters: None.

Optional parameters: None.

Encoding considerations: OCF ZIP container files are binary files 
   encoded in the application/zip media type.

Security considerations: All processors that read OCF ZIP container 
   files should rigorously check the size and validity of data 
   retrieved.

   In addition, because of the various content types that can be 
   embedded in OCF ZIP container files, application/epub+zip may 
   describe content that poses security implications beyond those 
   noted here. However, only in cases where the processor recognizes 
   and processes the additional content, or where further processing 
   of that content is dispatched to other processors, would security 
   issues potentially arise. In such cases, matters of security would 
   fall outside the domain of this registration document.

Security considerations that apply to application/zip also apply to 
   OCF ZIP container files.

Interoperability considerations: None.

Published specification: This media type registration is for the EPUB 
   Open Container Format (OCF), as described by the EPUB 3 
   specification located at https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/.

   The EPUB 3 specification supersedes both RFC 4839 and the Open 
   Container Format 2.0.1 specification, which is located at 
   http://idpf.org/epub/20/spec/OCF_2.0.1_draft.doc, and which also 
   uses the application/epub+zip media type.

Applications that use this media type: This media type is in wide use 
   for the distribution of ebooks in the EPUB format.

   File extension(s): OCF ZIP container files are most often 
      identified with the extension .epub.

   Macintosh file type code(s): ZIP

Fragment identifiers: EPUB Canonical Fragment Identifiers are custom 
   fragment identifiers defined for EPUB Publications. They may be 
   used to refer to an arbitrary content within any publication 
   resource defined for the publication. These identifiers are 
   defined at https://idpf.org/epub/linking/cfi/.
