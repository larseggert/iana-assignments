Media type name: application
Media subtype name: activity+json

Required parameters: None

Optional parameters:
None

Encoding considerations:
This JSON-based media is always represented in the
utf-8 charset. See [RFC 8259 section 8.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259#section-8.1).

Security considerations:
* https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/#security-considerations
* Executable Content - Most content with this media type is not executable. However, some values support any valid text/html value, and care should be taken when including these HTML values in other web documents. In particular, some consuming applications may sanitize this HTML to only include markup (e.g. dropping `<script />` tags).
* Privacy and Integrity - Information with this media type is not considered private. Instead privacy and integrity is usually provided by exchanging application/activity+json messages over a secure transport layer, e.g. [Transport Layer Security (TLS)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246).
* This media type inherits security considerations from
* The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Interchange Format - https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259#section-12
* Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax - https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-7
* Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs) - https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt
