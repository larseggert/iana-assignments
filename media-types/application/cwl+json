Media type name: application

Media subtype name: cwl+json

Required parameters: None

Optional parameters:None

Encoding considerations: binary

Security considerations: This media type represents a CWL documents 
   encoded using a subset of JSON. CWL parsers should take the same 
   security precautions applicable for JSON to avoid arbitrary code 
   execution and memory exhaustion. CWL documents typically reference 
   software containers and executors of CWL documents should evaluate 
   the security of third party containers before downloading or 
   executing them. Executing CWL documents with any combination of 
   third-party data or containers can lead to arbitrary code 
   execution and resource exhaustion. CWL executors should have 
   resource limits, logging, and other measures to control and 
   monitor usage. See 

   https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html

   https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/641.html

   CWL documents do not include digital signatures nor encryption of 
   the workflow descriptions themselves. Users with data integrity, 
   originator authenticity, and data confidentiality concerns with 
   respect to the workflow descriptions themselves should address 
   those concerns separately.

Interoperability considerations: The CWL standards include extensive 
   conformance tests

Applications which use this media: CWL has been used to exchange 
   command line tool and workflow definitions by many researchers and 
   scientists since the publication of version 1.0 in 2016. See 
   https://www.commonwl.org/gallery/ for a list of public sector 
   adopters across multiple domains and countries.

Fragment identifier considerations: Fragment identifiers in CWL URIs 
   are defined in 
   https://w3id.org/cwl/v1.0/SchemaSalad.html#Identifier_resolution

   The use of fragment identifiers in CWL URIs are to refer to 
   specific parts of the document, their use should not change the 
   result from a (HTTP) retrieval operation.
