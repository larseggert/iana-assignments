Required parameters : N/A

Optional parameters : N/A

Encoding considerations : binary
This media type may require encoding on transports not capable of handling binary.

Security considerations : 
Documents may contain script programs which are able to perform various 
actions on behalf of the user. Applications should make the user aware of 
this fact when opening a document of unknown/not-trusted origin.
Documents stored in the OpenDocument format may embed external objects
and/or may include hyper-links to other objects. Implementors should pay
special attention to security of resolving such external references.
In order to protect the privacy of information stored in documents,
Section 17.3 of the OpenDocument specification describes a mechanism
by which applications can encrypt documents in an interoperable way.
There are no mechanisms in OpenDocument v1.0 to verify the integrity
of documents (e.g. digital signatures). Users have to rely on external 
applications, should such integrity verification be required.

Interoperability considerations : 
- none -
