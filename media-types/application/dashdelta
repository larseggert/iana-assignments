MIME media type name : Application

MIME subtype name : Standards Tree - dashdelta

Required parameters : none

Optional parameters :
none

Encoding considerations : 8bit


Security considerations :
A Media Presentation Description (MPD) Delta contains text changes to an MPD. An 
MPD Delta is used together with a first MPD to construct a second MPD. As such, 
any security considerations for an MPD (media type application/dash+xml) may 
also be applicable to an MPD Delta. A MIME type handler would not launch a service 
with only an MPD Delta.

Further to this, as an MPD Delta performs editing operations on an MPD there are 
risks that deliberately malformed editing operations could cause security issues.


Interoperability considerations :

3GPP TS 26.247
