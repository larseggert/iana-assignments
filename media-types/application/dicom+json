Media type name: application
Media subtype name: dicom+json

Required parameters: N/A

Optional parameters:

"transfer-syntax" defines the DICOM Transfer Syntax 
[http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part05/chapter_10.html] 
used to encode any inline binary data present in the JSON metadata 
[http://dicom.nema.org/MEDICAL/Dicom/current/output/chtml/part18/sect_F.2.7.html]. 
The parameter is constructed as a numeric form OSI Object Identifier 
[ISO/IEC 8824].

Encoding considerations: 8bit
The 'application/dicom+json' media type is a JSON encoding of DICOM 
Information Objects.
Details of this encoding can be found in the DICOM Standard. Only 
UTF-8 encoding is used, not UTF-16 or UTF-32, so 8bit encoding is 
sufficient. 

Security considerations:
The DICOM JSON encoded data contains only bulk data (such as image 
pixel data) and metadata. As such, it does not in itself create 
security risks beyond the information disclosed on viewing the bulk 
data or metadata. There is no means to induce any particular behavior
by the recipient application. DICOM Information Objects encoded in 
the 'application/dicom+json' media type contain medical information, 
including personal information, so their transmission should be 
restricted to secure networks or within a secure wrapper that 
protects a personâ€™s right to confidentiality. Mechanisms such as 
HTTPS [RFC7230], Secured MIME (S/MIME) 
[RFC8551] or similar might be appropriate.

Since this media type employs JSON it inherits any security issues 
associated with that format [RFC7159].

Interoperability considerations:
This media type is a means of encoding a DICOM object in JSON format,
and identifying that a particular JSON model is used with a standard 
content type. The media type has been designed to ease access by 
generic applications that may not understand the traditional DICOM 
binary encoding, even though the DICOM content is specific to the 
medical (imaging) domain, such that a generic e-mail or HTTP 
application may not be able to interpret it. 

Published specification:
The DICOM JSON encoding is defined in DICOM PS3.18 Web Services - 
Annex F DICOM JSON Model 
[http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part18/chapter_F.html]

Applications which use this media:
The DICOM JSON encoding is primarily used in the medical field, 
particularly to encode metadata extracted from DICOM image objects 
in a form that is familiar to non-medical developers and is suitable 
for processing with conventional tools (such as JavaScript within a 
web browser). It is highly desirable that such metadata be made 
available using web services and identified with a standard media 
type.

Fragment identifier considerations:
No media type specific fragment identifier or fragment semantics 
are defined.

Restrictions on usage:
None.

Provisional registration? (standards tree only):
application/dicom+json

Additional information:

1. Deprecated alias names for this type: N/A
2. Magic number(s): N/A
3. File extension(s): .json
4. Macintosh file type code: 'TEXT'
5. Object Identifiers: N/A

General Comments:
The use of 'application/dicom+json' is not directly related to the 
specification of application/dicom [RFC3240], other than that the 
semantics (as opposed to the encoding) of the content is defined by 
the same standard [DICOM]. In particular, the use of 
'application/dicom+json' is fully specified in its own right, 
without any dependence on RFC3240, and none of the specifications 
of RFC3240 are inherited.
