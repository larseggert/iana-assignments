Type name: application

Subtype name: vnd.3gpp.seal-location-info+cbor

Required parameters: none

Optional parameters: modeltype

The "modeltype" parameter identifies a specific data type, e.g, "vnd.3gpp.seal-location-info+cbor;modeltype=location-report-configuration" where "location-report-configuration" indicates the "LocationReportConfiguration" data type in 3GPP TS 24.545 clause B.2.3.2.

Encoding considerations: Must be encoded as using IETF RFC 8949 [20]. See data types defined in 3GPP TS 24.545 clause B.2, B.3, and B.4 for details. Clause B.5 provides the media type structure and definition.

Security considerations: See Section 10 of IETF RFC 8949 [20] and Section 11 of IETF RFC 7252 [14].

Interoperability considerations: Applications must ignore any key-value pairs that they do not understand. This allows backwards-compatible extensions to this specification.

Published specification: 3GPP TS 24.545 "Location Management - Service Enabler Architecture Layer for Verticals (SEAL); Protocol specification", available via http://www.3gpp.org/specs/numbering.htm.

Applications that use this media type: Applications supporting the SEAL location management procedures as described in the published specification.

Fragment identifier considerations: Fragment identification is the same as specified for "application/cbor" media type in IETF RFC 8949 [20]. Note that currently that RFC does not define fragmentation identification syntax for "application/cbor".
