Media type name: application

Media subtype name: vnd.3gpp.GMOP+xml

Required parameters: none

Optional parameters:
"charset" the parameter has identical semantics to the charset parameter of the "application/xml" media type as specified in section 9.1 of IETF RFC 7303.

Encoding considerations: binary

Security considerations:
Same as general security considerations for application/xml media type as specified in section 10 of IETF RFC 7303. 
The information transported in this media type does not include active or executable content.
Mechanisms for privacy and integrity protection of protocol parameters are expected to be provided by the environment the media type operates in.
When a MIME body of the application/vnd.3gpp.GMOP+xml MIME type is transported over HTTP protocol over unsecured IP network, the integrity protection needs to be provided. Particularly, between the user agent and the entry point of the provider's network, the integrity protection is provided by TLS as described in 3GPP TS 24.482 (http://www.3gpp.org/ftp//Specs/archive/24_series/24.482/) subclause A.2.1.2.
When a MIME body of the application/vnd.3gpp.GMOP+xml MIME type is transported over SIP protocol and when required so by provider providing the "mission critical" service, the integrity protection of the MIME body needs to be provided. Particularly, the integrity protection of the MIME body is provided as described in 3GPP TS 24.379 (http://www.3gpp.org/ftp//Specs/archive/24_series/24.379/) subclause 6.6.1.3.
This media type does not include provisions for directives that institute actions on a recipient's files or other resources.
This media type does not include provisions for directives that institute actions that, while not directly harmful to the recipient, may result in disclosure of information that either facilitates a subsequent attack or else violates a recipient's privacy in any way.
This media type does not employ compression.

Interoperability considerations:
Same as general interoperability considerations for application/xml media type as specified in section 9.1 of IETF RFC 7303. Any unknown XML elements and any unknown XML attributes are to be ignored by recipient of the MIME body.

Published specification:
3GPP TS 24.481 "Mission Critical Services (MCS) group management; Protocol specification" version 13.4.0, available at http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/24_series/24.481/24481-d40.zip

Applications which use this media:
Applications supporting the Mission Critical Push To Talk (MCPTT) group management as described in the published specification.
