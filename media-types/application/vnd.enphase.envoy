MIME media type name: Application

MIME subtype name: Vendor Tree - vnd.enphase.envoy

Required parameters: version

   - version syntax: two or three decimal values separated by periods
   - version semantics: indicates the protocol version according to 
   Semantic Versioning (cf. http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

   The three decimal values are:

   * major - bumped for incompatible changes
   * minor - bumped for compatible changes (typically additions)
   * bugfix - optional and purely informative, indicating change in 
   implementation without a protocol change

Optional parameters: N/A

Encoding considerations: binary

Security considerations: Enphase Energy manufactures solar monitoring
   gateways, named Envoy. Envoy transmits reports to an Enphase 
   web-based monitoring platform, named Enlighten. Envoy reports, and 
   non-trivial Enlighten responses, will use this media type, which 
   includes encrypted and signed content. None of the content is 
   active or executable.

Interoperability considerations: Interoperability is not required 
   between Enphase and non-Enphase equipment. The version parameter 
   allows Enlighten to receive different format reports from 
   different versions of Envoy.

Published specification: N/A

Applications which use this media: Enphase Energy products and 
   services.

Fragment identifier considerations: N/A

Restrictions on usage: Intended for Enphase Energy products and 
   services only.
