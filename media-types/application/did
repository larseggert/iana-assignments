General Comments: This request is a long overdue registration request for the Decentralized Identifiers specification, whose initial 1.0 version reached W3C Recommendation status on July 19th, 2022 (more than two and a half years ago).

The media type was not registered at that time because of a Media Types with Multiple Suffixes decision that needed to be made by the IETF MEDIAMAN WG at the time. Now that the decision has been made (to not support media types with multiple suffixes), the W3C DID WG has a clear path to registering the media type that the group has resolved will cover v1.0, v1.1, and future versions of the specification: application/did.
