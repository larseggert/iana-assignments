MIME media type name : Application

MIME subtype name : Vendor Tree - vnd.eprints.data+xml

Required parameters : None

Optional parameters : charset

   Same as charset parameter of application/xml as specified in RFC 
   3023.

   files
   Indicates that file content has been embedded in the response XML. 
   This is used during content-negotiation to allow the client to 
   request file content be included. If the client does not have 
   permission to access file content this parameter will be ignored.

   "base64" is the only supported value and indicates that file 
   content has been embedded using base64 encoding. If the parameter 
   is empty or any other value the parameter meaning is undefined (in 
   a response) or should be ignored (during content negotiation).

Encoding considerations : binary

Security considerations : In addition to those of application/xml as 
   specified in RFC 3023, section 10 the following considerations 
   apply:

   No executable or active content is defined.

   No integrity features are defined by the media type, with the 
   exception that where files are embedded and checksums are provided 
   the ingesting service should verify the decoded file content 
   against its checksum before further processing those files.

   No explicit privacy features are defined by the media type but
   privacy-relevant metadata may be provided on an 
   implementation-specific basis.

   If files are embedded they may contain executable and/or malicious
   content. If file content is decoded care should be taken before any
   further processing or publication by for example applying a
   virus-checker.

   Record identifiers may be included that either intentionally or
   unintentionally conflict with existing identifiers in a consuming
   system. Care must be taken that existing records are not
   unintentionally overwritten. This can be achieved by assigning new 
   identifiers on ingest or by ensuring the current user is the owner 
   of the existing records.

   During ingest the system may choose to retrieve files included 
   by-URL reference. If the file is located on the Web (http: or 
   https:) the system should exercise caution to avoid being used by 
   untrusted users as a means of circumventing host-based 
   restrictions. URLs pointing to the local file-system must be 
   ignored for any untrusted sources.

Interoperability considerations :

Applications which use this media : EPrints http://www.eprints.org/

Additional information :

   1. Magic number(s) : None
   2. File extension(s) : .xml
   3. Macintosh file type code : "TEXT"
   4. Object Identifiers: None

Intended usage : Limited Use

   XML serialisation of EPrints Data (or "EPData") for the 
   import/export of the complete record. This is used e.g. for 
   ingesting the results of XSL transforms from standardised XML 
   formats. The mime-type is necessary to support correct 
   content-type negotiation when using the EPrints REST interface 
   although the client will require knowledge of the instance's
   database scheme.
