Media type name: application

Media subtype name: vnd.comicbook-rar

Required parameters: N/A

Optional parameters: N/A

Encoding considerations: binary

Security considerations:
All processors that read CBR files should rigorously check the size and 
validity of data retrieved.

Comic book archives consist of one or more image files in various formats, 
e.g., PNG or JPEG. Security considerations for the image formats all apply to 
CBR files. No executable content should be contained in a CBR file.

As CBR files are a form of RAR-compressed files, security considerations for 
RAR files also apply to CBR files. See also the IANA specification for the 
application/vnd.rar media type.

RAR files optionally provide both privacy protection, in the form of 
password-protected encrypted archives, and integrity protection through
internal routines, and these protections may be used for CBR files as well.

Interoperability considerations:
As there is no published specification for CBR files, different reading 
applications may exhibit different behaviors.

Published specification:
There has not been a published specification for CBR files per se; however,
the specification for RAR files generally is available at the developer's 
discretion from
<http://www.rarlab.com/technote.htm>.
