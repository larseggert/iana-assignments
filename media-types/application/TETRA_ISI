Type name: application

Subtype name: TETRA_ISI

Required parameters: N/A

Optional parameters: N/A

Encoding considerations: framed binary

Security considerations: The reference specifications detail how SIP 
   entities, each representing a TETRA Switching and Management 
   Infrastructure (SwMI), transport the TETRA_ISI media type and 
   handle message bodies that are identified by a particular header -
   the Inter-System Interface (ISI) header - that both identifies the
   particular TETRA Additional Network Feature (ANF) session that the
   message body refers to and carries related Protocol Data Units 
   (PDUs) between the endpoints, or SDP negotiations for set up of 
   streaming media. The ANFs handle Individual Calls, Group Calls, 
   Short Data Service and Mobility Management: the requirements, 
   architecture and creation of PDUs for each type of ANF are 
   specified in ETSI TS 100 392-3-12, ETSI TS 100 392-3-13, ETSI 100 
   392-3-14 and ETSI 100 392-3-15 respectively. 

   Information contained in the ISI will include sensitive user 
   information, potentially requiring use of encryption and 
   consequently it is recommended in ETSI TS 300 392-3-11 that the 
   path between two SwMIs is encrypted. 

   The Message Body Handling is consequently closely aligned with 
   that of the Session Initiation Protocol [RFC3261] and subject to 
   the security recommendations in that RFC.

   This media type does not employ compression.

   This payload format, which does not include any executable 
   content, does not exhibit any significant non-uniformity in the 
   immediate receiver side computational complexity for packet 
   processing and thus is not expected to pose a denial-of-service 
   threat due to the receipt of pathological data. 

   The protocol is designed with mechanisms to protect the receiving 
   functions from malformed PDUs. If a received message is detected 
   as malformed or incomplete in either header or underlying TETRA 
   PDU then an ISI Return Error message is sent as described in ETSI 
   TS 100 392-3-11. If a received message is addressed to an ANF 
   entity that is not present or not supported then an ISI Reject 
   message is sent as described in ETSI TS 100 392-3-11. 

   Consequently only well-formed and correctly addressed messages 
   will receive any significant processing effort.

   One of the key features of a TETRA system is to provide point to 
   multipoint group communication over a trunked link and thus it is 
   necessary to consider the risks of a denial-of-service threat or 
   abnormal response size threat due to the receipt of data that 
   seeks to exploit the one-to-many aspect of group communications, 
   or attempts to overload the link that the TETRA ISI is carried 
   over. The underlying TETRA protocols permit terminal configuration
   options by the network operator that enable transmitting users to 
   request disposition receipts for group-addressed messages and so, 
   if so allowed, it is possible for a single message carried over a 
   link using the TETRA_ISI media type to trigger the generation of a
   large number of disposition receipts by remote users in the 
   opposite direction along with the associated temporary spike in 
   traffic load. The TETRA ISI and TETRA protocols enable this risk 
   to be mitigated in a number of ways. 

   Firstly, it is already recommended in ETSI TS 100 392-3-11 that 
   the path between SwMIs which would carry the TETRA_ISI media type 
   is encrypted, which ensures that any such message cannot be 
   inserted into the transmit path other than by originating at a 
   valid endpoint SwMI. Secondly, a terminal is not normally 
   permitted to access a TETRA SwMI without passing an identification
   and authentication check to authorize use. The TETRA_ISI media 
   type supports the transfer of authentication parameters across the
   ISI link to allow migrating terminals to be authenticated when 
   both endpoints also support the authenticating function. It is 
   recommended that the authentication functionality is supported and
   thus terminals configured to allow response requests to group data
   should not be present on a system in an unintended way. Thirdly, 
   the process of connecting two or more SwMIs via the TETRA_ISI 
   media type is carried out via inter-operator agreement on the 
   configurations and services that may be used and consequently any 
   system where such group disposition notifications are allowed 
   should be bandwidth dimensioned to handle the traffic load from 
   such responses. 

   Further, the endpoints (SwMIs) are able to protect themselves from
   overloading due to the TETRA_ISI media type transport via use of 
   the ISI Reject message that indicates resource limitation as 
   described in ETSI TS 100 392-3-9.

   This application type provides a format for exchanging information
   in SIP, so the security considerations from RFC 3261 and its 
   subsequent updates and clarifications – e.g. RFC6026, RFC6141 - 
   apply. For streaming services, the Session Description Protocol 
   (SDP) and SDP Offer/Answer are used to negotiate and enable 
   streaming of the media and so the security considerations from 
   RFC4566 and RFC3264 apply to media negotiation within this 
   application type.

   The underlying specification ETSI TS 300 392-3-11 has a number of 
   RFCs as normative references and any implementation of this 
   content type should take the security considerations of these RFCs
   into account for the relevant deployment scenarios. 

Interoperability considerations: This media type carries TETRA 
   Inter-System Interface (TETRA ISI) application data as described 
   in ETSI TS 100 392-3-9. This media type is used in a SIP body as 
   specified in ETSI TS 100 392-3-11.
