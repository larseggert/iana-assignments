1. Media Type Name: application

2. Subtype name: standards tree urc-grpsheet+xml

3. Required parameters: none

4. Optional parameters: charset parameter (see definition of charset
parameter for application/xml, RFC 3023). The allowed values are:
"utf-8" [RFC2279] and "utf-16" [RFC2781]. In the absence of the
charset parameter, UTF-8 and UTF-16 are differentiated by the
procedure described in [XML 4.3.3].

Recommendation 26 November 2008. 4.3.3 Character Encoding in Entities.

5. Encoding considerations: binary

6. Security considerations:

The general utility of this media type to the Internet community is in
the area of remote user interfaces for devices and services that use
Internet-based technologies, in particular the Universal Remote
Console (URC) technology (ISO/IEC 24752). A Grouping Sheet contains a
grouping structure for a remote user interface that is based on URC
technology.

The basic (standardized) format of information contained in the media
type does not carry active or executable content.

For the protection of the privacy and integrity of a grouping sheet,
ISO/IEC 24752-5:2013 section 9.8 explicitly encourages vendors and
platform carriers to consider employment of privacy and integrity
services such as transport security. However, concrete measures in
this regard are outside the scope of this standard.

See also the security considerations described in section 10 of RFC
3023.

7. Interoperability considerations: Same as interoperability
considerations of text/xml as specified in RFC 3023.

8. Published specification: ISO/IEC 24752-5:2013 (currently in FDIS
vote)

9. Applications which use this media type: Universal Remote Console
clients, i.e. software and hardware for the purpose of remote control
of devices and services.

10. Additional information:

Magic number(s): Same as magic number(s) of text/xml as specified in
RFC 3023. File extension(s): .gsheet Macintosh file type code(s): not
assigned Object Identifier(s) or OID(s): not assigned

11. Intended usage: COMMON
