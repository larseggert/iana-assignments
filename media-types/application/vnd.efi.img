Media type name: application

Media subtype name: vnd.efi.img

Required parameters: None

Optional parameters: None

Encoding considerations: binary

Security considerations: UEFI firmware environment will mount the EFI 
   disk images as virtual disk device in pre-boot environment. 
   EFI disk images can store the same data as a real hard drive. That 
   means that they may contain arbitrary content, including but not 
   limited to active content. If the users do not trust the contents 
   of the EFI disk images, they should carefully check the contents 
   before using it (e.g. check the digital signatures of the EFI 
   executable image in it).

   The EFI disk image does not provide any confidentiality protection 
   of its own and requires external means if that is required.

   The EFI disk image does not use compression.

Interoperability considerations: EFI disk images require a UEFI 
   compliant firmware to mount it as virtual disk device for proper 
   execution.
