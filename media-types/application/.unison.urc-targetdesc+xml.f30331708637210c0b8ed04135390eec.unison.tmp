MIME media type name : Application

MIME subtype name : Standards Tree - urc-targetdesc+xml

Required parameters : none

Optional parameters : charset parameter (see definition of charset
parameter for application/xml, RFC 3023). The allowed values are:
"utf-8" [RFC2279] and "utf-16" [RFC2781]. In the absence of the
charset parameter, UTF-8 and UTF-16 are differentiated by the
procedure described in [XML 4.3.3].

Encoding considerations : binary


Security considerations : The general utility of this media type to
the Internet community is in the area of remote user interfaces for
devices and services that use Internet-based technologies, in
particular the Universal Remote Console (URC) technology (ISO/IEC
24752). A Target Description document contains discovery information
on a URC-compatible device/service, and links to related documents
such as Socket Descriptions and Resource Sheets.

The basic (standardized) format of information contained in the media
type does not carry active or executable content. However, the
<extension> and <mapping> elements (see ISO/IEC 24752-4:2013, sections
6.8.5, 6.13.11, and 6.14) that allow for vendor- and platform-specific
extensions, could potentially carry such content. ISO/IEC 24752-4:2013
contains a note that strongly discourages vendors to use the
<extension> element for active or executable content.

The information contained in the media type exposes discovery
information on target devices and applications that are - in most
cases - not sensitive to privacy and integrity. However, for sensitive
targets transport security (HTTPS) may be employed, providing a basic
level of integrity and privacy. This would prevent e.g. a spoofing
attack, in which a client may get directed to a wrong target, and thus
expose their login information to a third party.

Note: ISO/IEC 24752-4:2013 section 6.15 explicitly encourages vendors
and platform carriers to consider employment of privacy and integrity
services such as transport security. However, concrete measures in
this regard are outside the scope of this standard.

See also the security considerations described in section 10 of RFC
3023.

Interoperability considerations :


Published specification : ISO/IEC 24752-4:2013 (currently in FDIS
vote)

Applications which use this media : Universal Remote Console clients,
i.e. software and hardware for the purpose of remote control of
devices and services.
