Media type name: application

Media subtype name: vnd.wmap

Required parameters: N/A

Optional parameters: 

Parameter name: charset

Parameter value syntax: As defined in RFC 2045, Section 5.1 and RFC 2046, Section 4.1.2. The value must be a registered charset name from the IANA Character Sets registry.

Parameter semantics: Specifies the character encoding used to represent the textual content of the wmap file. The charset parameter follows the same syntax and semantics as defined for other text media types. Default value: UTF-8 (when charset parameter is not specified)

Encoding considerations: binary

The wmap format is a text-based format that uses UTF-8 encoding by default.

Content consists of human-readable text using standard Unicode characters.

The format is designated as "binary" encoding because:

- Line endings may be Unix (LF), Windows (CRLF), or classic Mac (CR) format, meaning CR and LF octets can appear outside of CRLF sequences

- No enforcement is made for line lengths, so in theory, component labels and note text content may potentially exceed 998 octets per line.

Security considerations: The wmap format is a declarative text format for describing Wardley Maps and poses minimal security risks. The format contains only textual data that describes components, relationships, and metadata.

As with any text format, implementations should validate input and handle malformed content gracefully. The format does not support executable code, external references, or embedded binary data.

Applications processing wmap files should implement appropriate input validation to prevent buffer overflows or denial of service attacks from malformed input.

Interoperability considerations: The wmap format is designed for interoperability between Wardley mapping tools and applications. The format uses a simple, line-oriented syntax that can be parsed by standard text processing tools.

Different line ending conventions (LF, CRLF, CR) are supported to ensure cross-platform compatibility. The grammar is case-insensitive for keywords while preserving original case for display purposes.

Published specification: The wmap format specification is defined using Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) and is available at: https://map.tranquil.systems/wmap-spec.ebnf.txt

Applications which use this media: 

- Map (macOS application for creating Wardley Maps) (https://map.tranquil.systems)
- Map for Linux (a linux port of Map currently in development)
- Map for Classic Mac (a classic mac app targetting system 6 - macOS 9, currently in development)

Fragment identifier considerations: No fragment identifier syntax is defined for the wmap format. Fragment identifiers are not applicable to this media type.

Restrictions on usage: None

Additional information:

1. Deprecated alias names for this type: N/A
2. Magic number(s): N/A
3. File extension(s): wmap
4. Macintosh file type code: N/A
5. Object Identifiers: N/A

General Comments: 

The wmap format supports the following entities:

- Components with positions and optional shapes
- Dependencies between components (lines and arrows)
- Textual notes at specific positions
- Stage boundaries for evolution axes
- Component groupings
- Inertia markers for components
- Evolution indicators showing component movement

The format is designed to be both human-readable and machine-parseable, enabling version control, diff tools, and other tooling.
