Type name: application

Subtype name: jscontact+json

Required parameters: None

Optional parameters: version

   This parameter conveys the version of the JSContact data in the body part. It MUST NOT occur 
   more than once. If this parameter is set, then the values of all JSContact version properties 
   in the body part MUST match the parameter value.

Encoding considerations: This is the same as the encoding considerations of application/json, as 
   specified in Section 11 of [RFC8259].

Security considerations: See Section 4 of [RFC-ietf-calext-jscontact-16].

Interoperability considerations: While JSContact is designed to avoid ambiguities as much as possible, 
   when converting objects from other contact formats to/from JSContact, it is possible that differing
   representations for the same logical data or ambiguities in interpretation might arise. The semantic
   equivalence of two JSContact objects may be determined differently by different applications, 
   for example, where URL values differ in case between the two objects.

Published specification: [RFC-ietf-calext-jscontact-16]

Applications that use this media type: Applications that currently make use of the text/vcard media type 
   can use this as an alternative.

Fragment identifier considerations: A JSON Pointer fragment identifier may be used, as defined in 
   [RFC6901], Section 6.
