Media type name: application

Media subtype name: aas+zip

Required parameters: N/A

Optional parameters: N/A

Encoding considerations: binary

Security considerations: This media type is a package container based on ZIP and may contain multiple embedded files and resources.

Receivers MUST treat the entire package as untrusted input.

Implementations SHOULD protect against decompression bombs (ZIP bombs) by enforcing limits on:

- Total uncompressed size
- Number of entries
- Compression ratio
- Any recursion/nesting behavior used by tooling

Implementations that extract files MUST prevent path traversal by rejecting entries with absolute paths, drive letters, or “..” segments, and SHOULD avoid overwriting existing files without explicit policy.

Since the container can embed arbitrary content, applications SHOULD validate embedded content types before processing.

Confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity are not provided by the container itself; use TLS for transport security and use signatures if tamper protection or provenance is required.

Interoperability considerations: The package structure, relationships, and mandatory parts are defined by the specifications of Industrial Digital Twin Association e.V.

Interoperability requires following the defined folder and relationship model and honoring the internal content type declarations.

Producers SHOULD avoid proprietary extensions unless they are clearly documented and safely ignorable by consumers.

Published specification: IDTA AAS Specification Part 5 — AASX Package File Format (https://industrialdigitaltwin.org/en/content-hub/aasspecifications)

Applications which use this media: Used for exchanging complete interoperable digital twin models as a single package file for upload/download, storage, and partner exchange in industrial digital twin scenarios.

Fragment identifier considerations: Not defined for this media type.

Restrictions on usage: None

Additional information:

1. Deprecated alias names for this type: N/A
2. Magic number(s): N/A
3. File extension(s): aasx
4. Macintosh file type code: N/A
5. Object Identifiers: N/A

General Comments: The content serves for the exchange of interoperable digital twin model information by the specifications of the AAS (Asset Administration Shell). The package format goes by AASX (serialized and zipped file information).
