BioPAX is a OWL-DL ontology plus additional semantic rules and best practices (which cannot be formally defined via OWL classes and restrictions). BioPAX data (a biological pathway, interactions model) is usually serialized as RDF/XML.

Although no byte sequences can be counted on to consistently
identify BioPAX, BioPAX documents will have the sequence
"http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl#" or "http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level2.owl#" to identify
the BioPAX namespace. This will usually be towards the top of
the document.

Intended usage : Common
BioPAX (Biological Pathway Exchange) is a standard language to represent biological pathways at the molecular and cellular level. Its major use is to facilitate the exchange of pathway data (http://www.biopax.org). Pathway data captures our understanding of biological processes, but its rapid growth necessitates development of databases and computational tools to aid interpretation. However, the current fragmentation of pathway information across many databases with incompatible formats presents barriers to its effective use. BioPAX solves this problem by making pathway data substantially easier to collect, index, interpret and share. BioPAX can represent metabolic and signaling pathways, molecular and genetic interactions and gene regulation networks. BioPAX was created through a community process. Through BioPAX, millions of interactions organized into thousands of pathways across many organisms, from a growing number of sources, are available. Thus, large amounts of pathway data are available in a computable form to support visualization, analysis and biological discovery.
