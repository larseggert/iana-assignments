Media type name: application

Media subtype name: geoxacml+json

Required parameters: N/A

Optional parameters: version: The version parameter indicates the 
   version of the OGC Geospatial eXtensible Access Control Markup 
   Language (GeoXACML) 3.0 JSON Profile v1.0 (GeoXACML 3.0 JSON 
   Profile) specification. It can be used for content negotiation 
   when dealing with clients and servers that support multiple 
   GeoXACML 3.0 JSON Profile versions. Its range is the range of 
   published GeoXACML 3.0 JSON Profile versions. As of this writing 
   those are: 1.0 [OGC 22-050r1]. These and future version 
   identifiers must follow the OGC patterns for versions [OGC 
   06-135]: the pattern includes the major and minor version numbers 
   to the first decimal place only (e.g., 1.1). If this parameter is 
   not specified by the client, the server is free to return any 
   version it deems fit. If a client cannot or does not want to deal 
   with that, it should explicitly specify a version.

Encoding considerations: binary

Same as for application/json [RFC 8259].

Security considerations: Per their specification, 
   application/geoxacml+json typed objects do not contain executable 
   content. However, these objects are JSON-based, and thus they have 
   all of the general security considerations presented in section 12 
   of [RFC 8259]. Because GeoXACML 3.0 JSON Profile is an extension 
   of [OASIS JSON Profile of XACML 3.0 Version 1.0] format, it 
   inherits the security considerations of XACML as well as any other 
   extensions that may be present.

Interoperability considerations: The JSON Profile of XACML 3.0 
   Version 1.0 specification defines no extensibility points. 
   Therefore, an Authorization Decision Request / Response formatted 
   according to the GeoXACML 3.0 JSON Profile is not backwards 
   compatible to the JSON Profile of XACML 3.0 Version 1.0 format.

Published specification: [OGC 22-050r1] OGC Geospatial eXtensible 
   Access Control Markup Language (GeoXACML) 3.0 JSON Profile v1.0

Applications which use this media: Potentially any application 
   implementing or using GeoXACML 3.0 Profile, as well as those 
   applications implementing or using specifications based on 
   GeoXACML 3.0 Profile.

Fragment identifier considerations: N/A

Intended usage: COMMON

   The OGC Geospatial eXtensible Access Control Markup Language 
   (GeoXACML) 3.0 JSON Profile v1.0 Standard defines an extension to 
   the OASIS JSON Profile of XACML 3.0 Version 1.0 for supporting 
   GeoXACML Authorization Decision Requests and Authorization 
   Decision encoded in JSON. This ensures an easy uptake in 
   environments where JSON is the preferred encoding.
