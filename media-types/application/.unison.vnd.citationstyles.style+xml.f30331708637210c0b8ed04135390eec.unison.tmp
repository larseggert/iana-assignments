MIME media type name : Application

MIME subtype name : Vendor Tree - vnd.citationstyles.style+xml

Required parameters : none

Optional parameters : none

CSL styles are typically encoded in utf-8. Parsed entities of this
media type which are stored in a different encoding must begin with a
text declaration containing an encoding declaration, following the
requirements specified in the "Character Encoding in Entities" section
of the XML specification (http://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#charencoding).

Encoding considerations : binary

Same as encoding considerations of application/xml as specified in RFC 7303.

Security considerations :

CSL is a markup language for specifying the metadata, layout, and
formatting of citation formats. CSL styles rely on so-called CSL
processors for interpretation, and don't contain executable code
themselves.

This media type does not provide its own privacy or integrity protection; in the
extent such protection is needed it must be provided externally.

Interoperability considerations :

There are no special interoperability issues. CSL style files are simple
plain-text files.

Published specification : Available at http://citationstyles.org/.

Applications which use this media :

Software products that are known to use CSL styles are listed at
http://citationstyles.org. These include the reference managers Zotero, Mendeley,
and Papers.

Fragment identifier considerations : none

Restrictions on usage : none

Provisional registration? (standards tree only) : n/a
