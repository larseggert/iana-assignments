Media type name: application

Media subtype name: p21+zip

Required parameters: none

Optional parameters: none

Encoding considerations: binary

Security considerations: This media type does not allow for any kind 
   of executable or active content and is nonextensible. As such, the 
   data elements currently defined in ISO 10303-21 do not in 
   themselves create security risks beyond the information disclosed, 
   since the elements are not used to induce any behavior by the 
   recipient software application.

   Security considerations that apply to application/zip also apply 
   to this media type.

Interoperability considerations: This media describes only the 
   structure and syntax of an exchange format. The semantics is given 
   by an EXPRESS schema which is referenced in the header section of 
   an exchange file.

Published specification: The specification is published as ISO 
   10303-21. The most recent specification is available from the ISO 
   website or from National standardization bodies for a nominal fee.

Applications which use this media: Applications that display, create, 
   edit, import, or export models, where the models are specified in 
   the EXPRESS language, encoded in the exchange syntax defined in 
   ISO 10303- 21, and compressed as ZIP, use this media type. While 
   the ISO 10303-21 syntax is also used in model/step+zip, models 
   specified with application/p21+zip are not limited to schemas 
   defined in ISO 10303.

Fragment identifier considerations: none

Restrictions on usage: none
