MIME subtype name: pkixcmp

Required parameters: -

Optional parameters: -

Encoding considerations:
Content may contain arbitrary octet values (the ASN.1 DER encoding of
a PKI message, as defined in the IETF PKIX Working Group
specifications).  base64 encoding is required for MIME e-mail; no
encoding is necessary for HTTP.

Security considerations:
This MIME type may be used to transport Public-Key Infrastructure
(PKI) messages between PKI entities.  These messages are defined by
the IETF PKIX Working Group and are used to establish and maintain an
Internet X.509 PKI.  There is no requirement for specific security
mechanisms to be applied at this level if the PKI messages themselves
are protected as defined in the PKIX specifications.

Interoperability considerations: -

Published specification: this document

Applications which use this media type:

protocols (as defined by the IETF PKIX Working Group) to send PKI
messages via E-Mail or HTTP.
