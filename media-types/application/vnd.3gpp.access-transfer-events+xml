MIME media type name : Application

MIME subtype name : Vendor Tree - vnd.3gpp.access-transfer-events+xml

Required parameters : None

Optional parameters : 
"charset" the parameter has identical semantics to the charset parameter of the "application/xml" media type as specified in section 9.1 of IETF RFC 7303.

"et" when the MIME type is included in the Accept header field, the "et" parameter value is a comma delimited list of the values of the "event-type" attribute of the <event> element of the <events> root element which the sender of the Accept header field is able to receive. The <events> root element is defined by XML schema described in the Published specification.

Encoding considerations : binary


Security considerations : 
Same as general security considerations for application/xml media type as specified in section 9.1 of IETF RFC 7303. In addition, this media type provides a format for exchanging information in SIP, so the security considerations from IETF RFC 3261apply.
The information transported in this media type does not include active or executable content.
Mechanisms for privacy and integrity protection of protocol parameters exist. Those mechanisms as well as authentication and further security mechanisms are described in 3GPP TS 24.229.
This media type does not include provisions for directives that institute actions on a recipient's files or other resources.
This media type does not include provisions for directives that institute actions that, while not directly harmful to the recipient, may result in disclosure of information that either facilitates a subsequent attack or else violates a recipient's privacy in any way.
This media type does not employ compression.


Interoperability considerations : 
Same as general interoperability considerations for application/xml media type as specified in section 9.1 of IETF RFC 7303. Any unknown XML elements and any unknown XML attributes are to be ignored by recipient of the MIME body.

Published specification : 
3GPP TS 24.237 "IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) Service Continuity", version 11.15.0, available via http://www.3gpp.org/specs/numbering.htm.

Applications which use this media : 
Applications supporting the service continuity as described in the published specification.

The handling in section 5 of IETF RFC 7303 applies.
