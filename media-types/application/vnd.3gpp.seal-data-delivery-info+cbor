Type name: application

Subtype name: vnd.3gpp.seal-data-delivery-info+cbor

Required parameters: none

Optional parameters: modeltype

The "modeltype" parameter identifies a specific data type, e.g, "vnd.3gpp.seal-data-delivery-info+cbor;modeltype=establishment-req" where "establishment-req" indicates the "EstablishmentRequest" data type in 3GPP TS 24.543 clause A.2.4.2.

Encoding considerations: Must be encoded as using IETF RFC 8949 [20]. See data types defined in 3GPP TS 24.543 clause A.2, A.3, and A.4 for details. Clause A.5 provides the media type structure and definition.

Security considerations: See Section 10 of IETF RFC 8949 [20] and Section 11 of IETF RFC 7252 [14].

Interoperability considerations: Applications must ignore any key-value pairs that they do not understand. This allows backwards-compatible extensions to this specification.

Published specification: 3GPP TS 24.543 "Data Delivery Management - Service Enabler Architecture Layer for Verticals (SEAL); Protocol specification", available via http://www.3gpp.org/specs/numbering.htm.

Applications that use this media type: Applications supporting the SEAL data delivery management procedures as described in the published specification.

Fragment identifier considerations: Fragment identification is the same as specified for "application/cbor" media type in IETF RFC 8949 [20]. Note that currently that RFC does not define fragmentation identification syntax for "application/cbor".
