Type name: application

Subtype name: protobuf+json

Required parameters: charset, which must be set to utf-8 (case-insensitive)

Optional parameters:

encoding, which indicates the type of Protobuf encoding and is json by default for application/protobuf+json, indicating the [ProtoJSON] format. At the time of writing, no other encoding can be used for application/protobuf+json so this parameter is for extensibility.

version, which indicates the version of the wire encoding specification (not the schema language), with default 1. At the time of writing, no protobuf wire encodings are versioned so this parameter is for extensibility. Unversioned wire encodings should be treated as having version 1.

Encoding considerations: Same as encoding considerations of application/json as specified in [RFC8259], Section 11.

Security considerations: see Section 6 of RFC-ietf-dispatch-mime-protobuf-06

Interoperability considerations: The Protobuf specification includes versioning provisions to ensure backward compatibility when encountering payloads with unknown properties.

Published specification: [Protobuf]

Applications that use this media type: Any application with a need to exchange or store structured objects across platforms or implementations.

Fragment identifier considerations: None.
