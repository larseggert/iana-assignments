1. Media Type Name:
application

2. Subtype name:
standards tree
urc-ressheet+xml

3. Required parameters:
none

4. Optional parameters:
charset parameter (see definition of charset parameter for 
application/xml, RFC 3023).
The allowed values are: "utf-8" [RFC2279] and "utf-16" [RFC2781]. 
In the absence of the charset parameter, UTF-8 and UTF-16 are 
differentiated by the procedure described in [XML 4.3.3].

[XML 4.3.3] Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Fifth Edition). 
W3C Recommendation 26 November 2008. 4.3.3 Character Encoding in 
Entities. http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#charencoding

5. Encoding considerations:
binary

6. Security considerations:

The general utility of this media type to the Internet community 
is in the area of remote user interfaces for devices and services 
that use Internet-based technologies, in particular the Universal 
Remote Console (URC) technology (ISO/IEC 24752). A Resource Sheet 
contains labels and other atomic resources for a remote user 
interface that is based on URC technology.

The basic (standardized) format of information contained in the 
media type does not carry active or executable content, except for 
the <content> and <contentAt> elements. These elements may provide 
or reference atomic resources such as labels in any format, including 
text, images, audio clips, and videos. These atomic resources are 
either referenced by URI and provided externally, or provided in the 
content of the media type, potentially encoded as Base64 or some 
other form of encoding binary content in text form. It is the 
responsibility of the users of the media type to protect themselves 
against security threads arising from parsing and rendering these 
atomic resources. ISO/IEC 24752-5:2013 includes a note as warning in 
this regard.

For the protection of the privacy and integrity of a resource sheet, 
ISO/IEC 24752-5:2013 section 7.8 explicitly encourages vendors and 
platform carriers to consider employment of privacy and integrity 
services such as transport security. However, concrete measures in 
this regard are outside the scope of this standard.

See also the security considerations described in section 10 of 
RFC 3023.

7. Interoperability considerations:
Same as interoperability considerations of text/xml as specified in 
RFC 3023.

8. Published specification:
ISO/IEC 24752-5:2013 (currently in FDIS vote)

9. Applications which use this media type:
Universal Remote Console clients, i.e. software and hardware for the 
purpose of remote control of devices and services.

10. Additional information:

Magic number(s): Same as magic number(s) of text/xml as specified in 
RFC 3023.
File extension(s): .rsheet
Macintosh file type code(s): not assigned
Object Identifier(s) or OID(s): not assigned

11. Intended usage:
COMMON
