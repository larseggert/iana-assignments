Type name: application

Subtype name: city+json

Required parameters: n/a

Optional parameters: n/a

Encoding considerations: binary

Security considerations: CityJSON shares security issues common to 
   all JSON content types, see RFC7159 Section 12.

   There are potentially two external URIs that need to be resolved: 
   (1) one for the coordinate reference system used, which links to 
   an XML file on the OGC server; (2) one for a CityJSON Extension, 
   which is also a JSON file.

   CityJSON does not provide executable content, and a CityJSON 
   Extension cannot contain executable content.

   CityJSON does not provide privacy or integrity services. If 
   sensitive data requires privacy or integrity protection, those 
   must be provided by the transport -- for example, Transport Layer 
   Security (TLS) or HTTPS. There will be cases in which stored data 
   need protection, which is out of scope for this document.

Interoperability considerations: The Extensions of CityJSON use extra
   JSON Schemas to document user-defined features in a CityJSON 
   document. It is recommended to make this Extension available at a 
   public URL.

Published specification: CityJSON specifications are available at 
   https://cityjson.org/specs/ and CityJSON is and international 
   standard adopted by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) (document 
   20-072r2).

Applications that use this media type: CityJSON is used for storing 
   the geometry, semantics and appearance of 3D city models. It is 
   used in geographic processing, geospatial databases, data 
   analysis, and 3D visualisation.

Fragment identifier considerations: n/a
