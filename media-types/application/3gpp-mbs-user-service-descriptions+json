Optional parameters: profiles (see clause E.2.2 of 3GPP TS 26.517)

Encoding considerations: binary

This is a JSON document, and the encoding considerations are the same as for media type application/json defined in IETF RFC 8259.

Security considerations: This media format is used to configure the receiver on how to participate in one or more MBS User Services. This format is highly susceptible to manipulation or spoofing for attacks desiring to mislead a receiver about a session. Both integrity protection and source authentication are recommended to prevent misleading of the receiver.

Interoperability considerations: The specification defines a platform-independent expression of an entry point document, and it is intended that wide interoperability can be achieved.

Published specification: 3GPP TS 26.517

Applications which use this media: 3GPP MBS-based applications and services

Fragment identifier considerations: The provisions of RFC 6901 (JSON Pointer) apply.
