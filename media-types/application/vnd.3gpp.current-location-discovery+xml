Media type name: application

Media subtype name: vnd.3gpp.current-location-discovery+xml

Required parameters: N/A

Optional parameters: "charset" - the parameter has identical 
   semantics to the charset parameter of the "application/xml" media 
   type as specified in section 9.1 of IETF RFC 7303

Encoding considerations: binary

Security considerations: same as general security considerations for 
   application/xml media type as specified in section 9.1 of RFC 
   7303. In addition, this media type provides a format for 
   exchanging information in SIP, so the security considerations from 
   RFC 3261 apply.

   The information transported in this MIME media type does not 
   include active or executable content.

   Mechanisms for privacy and integrity protection of protocol 
   parameters exist. Those mechanisms as well as authentication and 
   further security mechanisms are described in 3GPP TS 24.229.

   This media type includes provisions for directives that institute 
   actions on a recipient's files or other resources. The action is 
   providing the location information. The action is providing the 
   location information of the entity receiving the body. Except when 
   sent a part of an emergency session, the entity receiving the body 
   needs to request the user at the entity to authorize the action.

   This media type includes provisions for directives that institute 
   actions that, while not directly harmful to the recipient, may 
   result in disclosure of information that either facilitates a 
   subsequent attack or else violates a recipient's privacy in any 
   way. The action is providing the location information of the 
   entity receiving the body. Except when sent a part of an emergency 
   session, the entity receiving the body needs to request the user 
   at the entity to authorize the action.

   This media type does not employ compression.

Interoperability considerations: Same as general interoperability 
   considerations for application/xml media type as specified in 
   section 9.1 of IETF RFC 7303.

Published specification: 3GPP TS 24.229 "IP multimedia call control 
   protocol based on Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and Session 
   Description Protocol (SDP); Stage 3" clause 7.2A.18.11 available 
   at http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/24229.htm

Applications which use this media: This MIME type is used for a MIME 
   body within SIP INFO requests.

Fragment identifier considerations: The handling in section 5 of IETF 
   RFC 7303 applies
