Required parameters : N/A

Encoding considerations : binary

Security considerations :
CEA is a compressed container format used to contain descriptions for functional components for the evaluation and analysis of test data. As a ZIP format, CEA inherits all of the security considerations of ZIP specified in RFC 6839. Executable content is not allowed by the format. The format does not itself provide integrity or privacy protection. The security considerations of the media within the container need to be considered. CEA files always contain a descriptor file in XML format. The security considerations for XML in RFC 3023 apply to this file. Additionally, this file can contain URI referring to external web pages which may be fetched using the GetWebpage operation in the CEA protocol.

Interoperability considerations :

Published specification :
ASAM CEA

Applications which use this media :
The CEA format is used by applications that post-process and visualize test measurement data, realized by different functional components from different vendors.
