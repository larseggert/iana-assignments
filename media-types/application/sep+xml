Media type name: application

Media subtype name: sep+xml

Required parameters: None

Optional parameters: None

Encoding considerations: binary

Security considerations: This media type is used for energy 
   management (specifically for conveying information such as demand 
   response signals, pricing information, and energy usage 
   information) which may, depending on the circumstances, require 
   privacy and integrity protections. The specification provides for 
   this through the use of TLS.

   This media type does not contain active or executable content.
   However, the information provided may result in actions being 
   taken to adjust energy consumption or generation.

   For a more in-depth analysis of security considerations, as well as
   additional detail regarding the security mechanisms employed, 
   please see the specification.

Interoperability considerations:

Published specification: IEEE 2030.5

Applications which use this media: This media type is intended to be 
   used by any server which implements SEP 2.0. This media type is 
   also intended to be used by any client which implements SEP 2.0 
   using XML (as opposed to EXI, a binary encoding of XML).

Additional information:

   1. Magic number(s): None
   2. File extension(s): None
   3. Macintosh file type code: None
   4. Object Identifiers: None

Intended usage: Common

   This standard is intended for usage by any application that may 
   use the following information for Smart Grid home area networks 
   for information or control purposes: energy usage information, 
   pricing information, demand response and load control signals, 
   distributed energy resource information, etc.
