Type name: application

Subtype name: senml+json

Required parameters: none

Optional parameters: none

Encoding considerations: Must be encoded as using a subset of the
encoding allowed in [RFC8259].  See RFC 8428 for details.  This
simplifies implementation of a very simple system and does not impose
any significant limitations as all this data is meant for machine-to-
machine communications and is not meant to be human readable.

Security considerations: See Section 13 of RFC 8428.

Interoperability considerations: Applications MUST ignore any JSON
key-value pairs that they do not understand unless the key ends with
the "_" character, in which case an error MUST be generated.  This
allows backwards-compatible extensions to this specification.  The
"bver" field can be used to ensure the receiver supports a minimal
level of functionality needed by the creator of the JSON object.

Published specification: RFC 8428

Applications that use this media type: The type is used by systems
that report, e.g., electrical power usage and environmental
information such as temperature and humidity.  It can be used for a
wide range of sensor reporting systems.

Fragment identifier considerations: Fragment identification for
application/senml+json is supported by using fragment identifiers as
specified by RFC 8428.
