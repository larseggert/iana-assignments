MIME media type name : Application

MIME subtype name : Vendor Tree - vnd.eszigno3+xml

Required parameters : None.

Optional parameters : None.

   Note: The character set is always defined is the XML declaration 
   of the file and it can be either UTF-8 or ISO-8859-2. Thus having 
   a charset parameter would be redundant.

Encoding considerations : 8bit

   This media type may require encoding on transports not capable of 
   handling 8 bit text.

Security considerations : The file consists of XML labels and 
   unformatted text contents. Executable content is not allowed.

   While it is an XML signature file (adequate to RFC 3275 and ETSI 
   TS 101 903 v1.2.2.), integrity of the most elements (the signed 
   elements) is provided.

   It is not necessary to protect the content for confidentiality -- 
   it depends on the application area and the decision of the users.
   In default case, confidentiality is not provided. But if someone 
   decides that he/she needs confidentiality-protection, the original 
   file can be encrypted and placed into a data structure having the 
   same (vnd.eszigno3+xml) format. Existing application (e.g. 
   MICROSEC e-Szignó 3.1) supports this operation.

Interoperability considerations : The format fulfils the requirements 
   of RFC 3275 and ETSI TS 101 903 v1.2.2.
