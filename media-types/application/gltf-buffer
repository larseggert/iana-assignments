Media type name: application
Media subtype name: gltf-buffer

Required parameters: None

Optional parameters: None

Encoding considerations: binary

Security considerations: The gltf-buffer object consists of one more 
   arrays of binary values - either bytes (8 bit), words (16 bit) or 
   floating point (32 bit). These arrays are referenced by offset 
   and length from a separate but associated object (the glTF json). 
   Data from the glTF-buffer object is then used to construct 3D 
   models. 

   As such, gltf-buffer cannot contain executable content, nor do 
   they provide any form of confidentiality or integrity protection. 
   Such protection, if desired, must be provided externally.

Interoperability considerations: glTF documents are designed to 
   provide interoperability between content creation and processing 
   tools, and visualization applications. In this context gltf-buffer 
   objects are used to store binary geometry and animation data, and 
   other buffer-based data that can be used with 3D graphics APIs 
   like DirectX, Metal, OpenGL, Vulkan and WebGL. 

Published specification:
   glTF overview and specification: https://www.khronos.org/gltf/ 

   This media type is for the binary file that can store graphics 
   buffer based data like 3D geometry and animations: https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/master/specification/2.0/README.md#gltf-basics 


Applications which use this media: Several graphics oriented 
   applications, frameworks or libraries have adopted glTF as 
   supported file format:
   
   * three.js - A library that makes WebGL - 3D in the browser.
   * Babylon.js - An open source 3D engine based on WebGL and 
     Javascript
   * Microsoft is adding support for .gltf files across a variety of 
     applications including Paint 3D, remix3d.com and Microsoft Office
   * Facebook is using glTF for its 3D Posts capabilities
   * Google is using glTF for delivering 3D models from its poly 
     website
   * Sketchfab has download APIs for 3d models using glTF 
   * Blender is working on support for glTF 2.0 export There are 
     converters from COLLADA and OBJ, so exports from DCC tools such 
     as 3ds Max, Maya, Modo, Poser and Blender can easily be
     converted to glTF.

Intended usage: Common

   glTFâ„¢ 2.0 (GL Transmission Format) is a royalty-free 
   specification  for the efficient transmission and loading of 3D 
   scenes and models by applications. glTF minimizes both the size 
   of 3D assets, and the runtime processing needed by 3D 
   applications. glTF defines a common publishing format for 3D 
   content tools and services that streamlines authoring workflows 
   and enables interoperable use of content across the industry.
