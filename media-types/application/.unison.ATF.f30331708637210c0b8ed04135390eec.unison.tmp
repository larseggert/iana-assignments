Security considerations:
ATF is an import and export format for test data. Any security considerations which apply to Text/Plain also apply to ATF. Executable content is not allowed by the format. The format does not itself provide integrity or privacy protection. However, the format contains access control information for the data included in the file. The access control information is imported into data bases and then controls access to the imported data via the ODS API. Appropriate care should be taken when constructing, interpreting, and transporting this material.

Interoperability considerations :
