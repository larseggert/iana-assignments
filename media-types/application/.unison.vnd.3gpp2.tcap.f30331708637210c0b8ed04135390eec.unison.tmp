MIME media type name : Application

MIME subtype name : Vendor Tree - vnd.3gpp2.tcap

Required parameters : None.

Optional parameters :
The 'version' parameter identifies the TCAP protocol version being
transported as MIME. The version parameter should clearly indicate
whether the TCAP is ANSI or ITU-T and version numberof the protocol. For
example, version="ANSI T1.114-1988" or version="ITU-T Q.771 03/93". The
first word of the "version" value contains the string "ANSI" or "ITU-T".
If the first word is "ANSI", the the second part includes the entire
specification number (e.g., T1.114-1998). If the first word is "ITU-T",
the second part includes the ITU-T specification number (e.g., Q.771)
and the month/year (e.g., 03/93) when the specification was published.

If the version parameter is absent, the default version corresponds to
"ANSI T1.114-1988".

Encoding considerations : binary
The TCAP messages are encoded in binary. The message format of the TCAP
message is specified according to the 'version' parameter (e.g., "ANSI
T1.114-1988"). This media type may require encoding on transports not
capable of handling binary.

Security considerations :
The TCAP message may contain user confidential and network confidential
information. Integrity and privacy protection are desired, but not
required, when transporting this media type. The content may not provide
inherent security. So, security mechanisms at the transport layer are
needed to provide integrity and privacy of the content.

The TCAP message may be used to transport other protocols which may
contain executable content. Handling of security in such cases is left
up to the particular protocol.

Interoperability considerations :
The MIME type allows for interoperability between the TCAP transported
over IP-based and non-IP based systems systems.
