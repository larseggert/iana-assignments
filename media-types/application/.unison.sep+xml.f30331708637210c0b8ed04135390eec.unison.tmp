MIME media type name : Application
MIME subtype name : Standards Tree sep+xml

Required parameters : level=(-|+)S[i]

Explanatory text from the specification (Section 7.8):
The base schema, used in communication, should be declared in a short
and clear string. This section defines the rules for a string used to
declare acceptable encodings and extensions of a node. The Extensibility
Level defines the base schema and its capability for arbitrary
extension. The Extensibility Level string is one of "-S0" or "+S0". The
application/sep-exi indicates EXI capability. The S0 indicates the base
schema version: SEP2 (Smart Energy Profile, version 2.0). "-S0"
indicates the node does not accept arbitrary
tags that are not defined in the base schema, and "+S0" indicates it
accepts arbitrary tags. A node with "-S0" MAY return error on EXI or XML
message with arbitrary types, elements, and attributes that are not
defined in the schema used for encoding. Sending messages with arbitrary
types, elements, and attributes on nodes that declare "-S0" SHOULD be
avoided.
The format of level string is '(-|+)S[i]' where i is a character to
describe base schema version (currently '0'). As extension of SEP2.x
schemas should be backward compatible, a node declares schema ID 'S[i]'
can be assumed to be compatible for all versions between 'S0' and 'S[i]'.
A client SHOULD check if a server accepts non-strict part of EXI
document prior to PUT/POST operations on the server before sending
message with extended attributes/elements. A server SHOULD check if a
client accepts extended non-strict part of EXI document prior to give
responses to GET operations to the client before returning message with
extended attributes/elements.

Optional parameters :
None

Encoding considerations : binary

Security considerations :
This media type is used for energy management (specifically for
conveying information such as demand response signals, pricing
information, and energy usage information) which may, depending on the
circumstances, require privacy and integrity protections. The
specification provides for this through the use of TLS.

This media type does not contain active or executable content.
However, the information provided may result in actions being taken to
adjust energy consumption or generation.

For a more in-depth analysis of security considerations, as well as
additional detail regarding the security mechanisms employed, please
see the specification.

Interoperability considerations :

Published specification :
Smart Energy Profile 2.0, freely and publicly available at
http://zigbee.org/smartenergy

Applications which use this media :
This media type is intended to be used by any server which implements
SEP 2.0. This media type is also intended to be used by any client which
implements SEP 2.0 using XML (as opposed to EXI, a binary encoding of
XML).

Additional information :

1. Magic number(s) : None
2. File extension(s) : None
3. Macintosh file type code : None
4. Object Identifiers: None

There will also be an application for application/sep-exi, a related
media type.

Intended usage : Common
This standard is intended for usage by any application that may use the
following information for Smart Grid home area networks for information
or control purposes: energy usage information, pricing information,
demand response and load control signals, distributed energy resource
information, etc.
