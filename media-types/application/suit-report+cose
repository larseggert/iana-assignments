Type name:
application

Subtype name:
suit-report+cose

Required parameters:
n/a

Optional parameters:
n/a

Encoding considerations:
binary (CBOR)

Security considerations:
Section 10 of RFC-ietf-suit-report-19

Interoperability considerations:
SUIT Reports are encoded as CBOR and optionally wrapped in any COSE structure (e.g., COSE_Sign1, COSE_Mac0, COSE_Encrypt0). Receivers must be able to identify and process the COSE envelope used and support compatible COSE algorithms for validation or decryption. All versioning and structure are self-describing within the CBOR SUIT_Report format, and no media-type parameters are used for negotiation. Interoperability therefore depends on shared deployment profiles that specify the expected COSE protections and algorithms. Comprehension of a SUIT Report is dependent on obtaining a matching SUIT Manifest. The structure is effectively opaque if the matching SUIT Manifest cannot be sourced.

Published specification:
RFC-ietf-suit-report-19

Applications that use this media type:
SUIT Manifest Processor, SUIT Manifest Distributor, SUIT Manifest Author, RATS Attesters, RATS Verifiers

Fragment identifier considerations:
The syntax and semantics of fragment identifiers are as specified for "application/cose".
