MIME media type name : Application

MIME subtype name : Vendor Tree - vnd.cendio.thinlinc.clientconf

Required parameters : None.

Optional parameters : None.

Encoding considerations : 8bit
This media type may require encoding on transports not capable of
handling 8 bit text.

Security considerations :
The configuration file does not contain any executable code or
macros. It can however contain login credentials. Implementations
should avoid storing the data on disk longer than necessary and should
make sure that the data is handled with care. During transfer, both
integrity and confidentiality protection should be used. The
Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol is recommended.

Interoperability considerations :
Configuration files for the ThinLinc Client can use either CR or CRLF
line breaks. Implementations should accept both variants. The transport
does not need to preserve the line break style.

Published specification :
A full specification is not available at this time. The file format
and allowed configuration parameters are however documented in the
ThinLinc Administrator's Guide, available from
http://www.cendio.com/support/tag.


Applications which use this media :
The ThinLinc Client.

Additional information :

1. Magic number(s) : -

instructs the ThinLinc Client how to establish the connection.
