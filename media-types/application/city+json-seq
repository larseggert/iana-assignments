Media type name: application

Media subtype name: city+json-seq

Required parameters: N/A

Optional parameters: N/A

Encoding considerations: binary

Security considerations: CityJSON shares security issues common to all JSON content types, see RFC7159 Section 12.

Interoperability considerations: The Extensions of CityJSON use extra JSON Schemas to document user-defined features in a CityJSON document. It is recommended to make an Extension available at a public URL.

Published specification: CityJSON specifications are available at https://cityjson.org/specs/, and CityJSON is an international standard adopted by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) (CityJSON Community Standard 2.0, document 20-072r5, https://docs.ogc.org/cs/20-072r5/20-072r5.html).

Applications which use this media: CityJSON Text Sequence is a format based on JSON Text Sequences and CityJSON, inspired by GeoJSON Text Sequences. The idea is to decompose a (often large) CityJSON dataset into its features (eg each building, each bridge, each road, etc.), to create several JSON objects (of type CityJSONFeature), and stream/store them in a JSON Text Sequence (for instance ndjson â€“ newline delimited JSON).

Fragment identifier considerations: N/A

Restrictions on usage: none

Additional information:

1. Deprecated alias names for this type: N/A
2. Magic number(s): N/A
3. File extension(s): N/A
4. Macintosh file type code: N/A
5. Object Identifiers: N/A
