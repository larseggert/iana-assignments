Media type name: application

Media subtype name: 3gppHalForms+json

Required parameters: N/A

Optional parameters: N/A

Encoding considerations: binary
   The HAL-FORMS media type design follows many of the HAL media 
   type conventions. As indicated in 
   https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kelly-json-hal-08, a HAL 
   Document uses the format described in [RFC4627] and has the 
   media type "application/hal+json". The binary 
   content-transfer-encoding must be used.

Security considerations: See RFC 8259, section 12.
   This media type does not allow for executable content.

Interoperability considerations: See RFC 8259

Published specification:
   3GPP TS 3GPP TS 29.501 "5G System; Principles and Guidelines for 
   Services Definition; Stage 3", version 16.5.0, available via 
   https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/29_series/29.501/29501-g50.zip.

Applications which use this media:
   This media type is intended as to be used as HTTP body by 3GPP 
   applications supporting the 3GPP hypermedia format as defined in the referenced specifications.

Fragment identifier considerations: N/A

Restrictions on usage: N/A

Additional information:

1. Deprecated alias names for this type: N/A
2. Magic number(s): N/A
3. File extension(s): N/A
4. Macintosh file type code: N/A
5. Object Identifiers: N/A

General Comments:
   This media type registration in the standards tree is registered 
   by 3GPP, a recognized standards-related organization. It is used 
   over internal 3GPP interfaces and on interfaces to external 
   organizations.
   The HAL media type is a popular format for representing API 
   responses. HAL has been initially specified in an expired 
   internet draft available at 
   "https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kelly-json-hal-08". The media 
   type "application/3gppHalForms+json" is an extension of the basic 
   3GPP hypermedia format derived from the Hypertext Application 
   Language (HAL). As described in section 4.7.2.2 of TS 29.501, it 
   includes an additional "_templates" attribute. The usage of this 
   media type is further described in 
   https://rwcbook.github.io/hal-forms.
