Media type name: application

Media subtype name: vnd.3gpp.gtpc

Required parameters: N/A

Optional parameters: N/A

Encoding considerations: binary

   The media type encodes an GTP-C message (as specified in 3GPP TS 
   29.274), including IP and UDP headers.

Security considerations: The information transported in this media 
   type does not include active or executable content.

Interoperability considerations: The media type allows for 
   interoperability of GTP-C messages transmitted over Service Based 
   Interfaces (SBI).

   The GTP-C messages are sent over SBI between core network control 
   plane entities in 5G mobile networks.

Published specification: 

   3GPP TS 29.518 available at
   http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/29518.htm

Applications which use this media: Applications that exchanging GTP-C 
   messages over Service Based Interfaces (SBI).

Fragment identifier considerations: N/A

Restrictions on usage: N/A
