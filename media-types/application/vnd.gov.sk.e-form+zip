MIME media type name : Application

MIME subtype name : Vendor Tree - vnd.gov.sk.e-form+zip

Required parameters : None

Optional parameters : None

Encoding considerations : binary

Security considerations :
The files carried inside the electronic forms (e-forms) container may 
contain script and other active content: all definitions, schemas, 
transformations and other files needed for a visual and other 
presentations of an electronic e-form, for filling an e-form, 
validation of filled data, etc.
The e-forms container may contain malicious code and hence unless the 
source is trusted the usual protection against malware and viruses 
should be applied. Sandbox or safe operation set is recommended for 
processing of the container contents.
The integrity of the data should be guaranteed externally by the 
electronic signature and/or through the use of SSL/TLS transport 
protocol and cryptographic hash functions.

All definitions and files needed for use of any publicly available 
e-government electronic form must be published in the e-forms 
container and must not use any encryption. Publicly available e-forms 
containers shall not contain any private or confidential data. Privacy 
of non-public e-forms containers can be guaranteed through the use of 
ZIP encryption features or externally, e.g. through the use of SSL/TLS 
transport protocol. In case the container is used for storage of 
private or confidential data (e.g. filled in the presentation of the 
e-form), the container should not be available publicly.
Security consideratons for application/zip also apply to this media type.


Interoperability considerations :
For public administration electronic forms in Slovakia only features 
defined in ZIP version 2.0 specification must be used.

Published specification :
The specification is published by the Ministry of Finance of the 
Slovak Republic as a legislative document: Edict About Standards for 
information systems of public administration - No. 55/2014 Z. z., 
(Annex 3 - Standard for eGovernment forms) pursuant to Act No. 
275/2006 Coll. on information systems of public administration.

Name of the Edict in Slovak: "Výnos o štandardoch pre informačné 
systémy verejnej správy č. 55/2014 Z. z. (Príloha č. 3 - Štandard pre 
elektronické formuláre)"

The container has two equal forms: XML structure 
(application/vnd.gov.sk.e-form+xml) and a file structure in a ZIP 
container (application/vnd.gov.sk.e-form+zip).

The electronic forms container will contain all definitions, schemas, 
transformations and files needed for a visual and other presentation 
of an e-government e-form, for filling an e-form, validation of filled 
data, etc.

The e-forms container is based on existing standards: JAR file format, 
DublinCore, Open Packaging Format, OpenDocument format, EPUB Open 
Container Format. The e-forms container also extends these standards 
for specific e-forms usage.

The specification is maintained by the Committee for standardization 
of information systems of public administration, which is the main 
advisory body for standardization established by Ministry of Finance 
of the Slovak republic. Members of the Committeee compose of wide 
spectrum of experts, representing public, private and academic 
sectors. Source: http://informatizacia.sk/standards-for-is-pa/4632s
