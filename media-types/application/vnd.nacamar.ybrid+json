Media type name: application

Media subtype name: vnd.nacamar.ybrid+json

Required parameters: none

Optional parameters:

   version (no default, auto-detection required, only valid value as 
   of time of registration is "v2")

   The syntax of all values must conform to the ABNF:

   version = *(ALPHA / DIGIT / "." / "-")

Encoding considerations: binary

Security considerations: This media type inherits the issues common 
   to all JSON media types - see RFC 8259, Section 12.

   This media type include control and information data but does 
   not provide integrity or privacy protection. Thus the data
   should be transferred over a channel that provides authenticity and
   integrity. If the data contains sensitive information it should be
   transferred over an encrypted channel.

   No directly executable code is transferred using this media type.
   However the data may contain control instructions that may still 
   allow for attacks. Such attacks could include (but are not limited 
   to) requesting expensive operation in order to perform a DoS 
   attack. Implementing interpreters should therefore at least: a) 
   verify the source of the control data, b) and exhaustive 
   validation of the provided data, c) and implement limitation of 
   used resources to process the data.

   Both control and informational data maybe be included referencing
   external resources e.g. by the means of URIs. This includes but is 
   not limited to redirection to other resources as well as status 
   reporting to given endpoints. External resources that may be 
   referenced may provide additional security risks to be considered 
   by the implementing interpreter. Also attacks based on the fact 
   that cross origin references are valid must be considered. Status 
   reporting requested by the control data or implicit status 
   reporting by requesting information references may interfere with 
   the implementation’s clients user privacy policy.

Interoperability considerations: The data identified by this media 
   type is human readable information formatted as JSON. Thus it is 
   expected to be interoperable across many platforms and 
   applications.
