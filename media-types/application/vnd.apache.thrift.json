MIME media type name : Application

MIME subtype name : Vendor Tree - vnd.apache.thrift.json

Required parameters : none

Optional parameters : 
none

Encoding considerations : 8bit

This Apache Thrift specific JSON-based type is always encoded in utf-8.

Security considerations : 
Apache Thrift does not enforce a security mechanism.
Users define security features at application or transport level.
The data carried by Apache Thrift is essentially arbitrary, and can include
active or executable content. Apache Thrift does not provide or enforce a
security mechanism, so appropriate mechanisms must be implemented at the
application or transport level. 

Interoperability considerations : 
Today only x-thrift is used and we have different protocols.
The endpoints need to know what protocol is used and the Content-Type within
the HTTP Headers is only informal. We want to fix this with proper 
Content-Types.
That's why we do the registration here and adopt it on Apache Thrift 
afterwards.

http://thrift.apache.org
