Media type name: application

Media subtype name: vnd.3gpp.mcvideo-location-info+xml

Required parameters: None

Optional parameters: 
   "charset" the parameter has identical semantics 
   to the charset parameter of the "application/xml" media type as 
   specified in section 9.1 of IETF RFC 7303.

Encoding considerations: binary

Security considerations: This XML-based media type inherits the 
   general security considerations for application/xml media type as 
   specified in section 9.1 of IETF RFC 7303. In addition, this media
   type provides a format for exchanging information in SIP, so the 
   security considerations from IETF RFC 3261 apply.

   The information transported in this media type does not include 
   active or executable content.

   Mechanisms for privacy and integrity protection of protocol 
   parameters exist. Those mechanisms as well as authentication and 
   further security mechanisms are described in 3GPP TS 24.229.

   This media type does not include provisions for directives that 
   institute actions on a recipient's files or other resources.

   This media type does not include provisions for directives that 
   institute actions that, while not directly harmful to the 
   recipient, may result in disclosure of information that either 
   facilitates a subsequent attack or else violates a recipient's 
   privacy in any way.

   This media type does not employ compression.

   Any unknown XML elements and any unknown XML attributes are to be 
   ignored by recipient of the MIME body.

Interoperability considerations: Same as general interoperability 
   considerations for application/xml media type as specified in 
   section 9.1 of IETF RFC 7303

Published specification: 3GPP TS 24.281 "Mission Critical Video 
   (MCVideo) call control" version 14.3.0, available at 
   http://www.3gpp.org/ftp//Specs/archive/24_series/24.281/

Applications which use this media: Applications supporting the 
   mission critical video as described in the published 
   specification.

Fragment identifier considerations: The handling in section 5 of IETF
   RFC 7303 applies.
