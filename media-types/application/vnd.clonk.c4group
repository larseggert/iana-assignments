MIME media type name : Application

MIME subtype name : Vendor Tree - vnd.clonk.c4group

Required parameters : none

Optional parameters :
none

Encoding considerations : binary
This media type may require encoding on transports not capable of
handling binary.

Security considerations :
C4Group files often have scripts in them which are intended to be
executed by the game. A malicious script can cause the game to hang. It
is also probable that a script can trick the game into executing
arbitrary instructions. The game does no integrity checking except to
ensure that all players in a network game have the same game data.
Scripts can easily change the game state of any participating player.

Players are advised to treat C4Group files like executable files.

Interoperability considerations :
While the c4group file uses a custom format, its contents are mostly
files with common content types.
