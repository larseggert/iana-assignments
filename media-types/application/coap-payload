Type name: application

Subtype name: coap-payload

Required parameters: cf (CoAP Content-Format integer in range 0-65535
   denoting the content format of the CoAP payload carried, as defined
   by the "CoAP Content-Formats" subregistry that is part of the
   "Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) Parameters" registry.)

Optional parameters: None

Encoding considerations: Common use is BINARY.  The specific CoAP
   content format encoding considerations for the selected Content-
   Format (cf parameter) apply.  The encoding can vary based on the
   value of the cf parameter.

Security considerations: The specific CoAP content format security
   considerations for the selected Content-Format (cf parameter) apply.

Interoperability considerations: This media type can never be used
   directly in CoAP messages because there are no means available to
   encode the mandatory 'cf' parameter in CoAP.

Published specification: (this I-D - TBD)

Applications that use this media type: HTTP-to-CoAP Proxies.

Fragment identifier considerations: CoAP does not support URI
   fragments; therefore a CoAP payload fragment cannot be identified.
   Fragments are not applicable for this media type.

Intended usage: COMMON

Restrictions on usage:

An application (or user) can only use this media type if it has to
   represent a CoAP payload of which the specified CoAP Content-Format
   is an unrecognized number; such that a proper translation directly to
   the equivalent HTTP media type is not possible.
