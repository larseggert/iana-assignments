Media type name: application

Media subtype name: vnd.apache.parquet

Required parameters: N/A

Optional parameters: N/A

Encoding considerations: binary

Security considerations: Apache Parquet can be used to store arbitrary data which may or may not be sensitive in nature. Executable content is not expected. Apache Parquet supports multiple compression codecs and a single file may contain uncompressed and compressed regions. Apache Parquet files may be encrypted using mechanisms suitable for other file formats or using the format's modular encryption mechanism, whereby a file may contain both unencrypted and encrypted data regions.

Interoperability considerations: Apache Parquet is designed to be highly-interoperable and can be read and written using software libraries and applications written in a wide variety of programming languages running on many platforms. The format is versioned and developed in a backwards-compatible fashion. Users can generally expect Apache Parquet files created by one system to be read in correctly by another system.
