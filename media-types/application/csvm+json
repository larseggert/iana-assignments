and

section 7. Security Considerations of this specification
[[
Applications that process tabular data may use that data to drive other actions, which may have security implications. These behaviors are outside the scope of this specification.

Third party metadata provided about a tabular data file (such as a CSV file) may rename or ignore headers, or exclude rows or columns, which may lead to data being misinterpreted by applications that process it.

Transformation definitions are a possible security risk as they enable the creators of metadata to reference arbitrary code that may be executed to convert tabular data into other formats. Implementations should run this arbitrary code in a sandboxed environment to reduce the security risk.
]]


Interoperability considerations : 
Note that this format is not the same as the existing text/csv and text/tab-delimited-values mediatypes, but a JSON-based format used to annotate such documents. Also see [RFC7159] for interoperability information for JSON.

Applications which use this media : 
It is anticipated that there is a broad need for data validators and converters to alternate structured representations of tabular data. It is expected that many applications and programming languages will be using this media type across many operating systems.
