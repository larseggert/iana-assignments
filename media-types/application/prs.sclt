Media type name: application

Media subtype name: prs.sclt

Required parameters: N/A

Optional parameters: N/A

Encoding considerations: 8bit

Security considerations: SCOLT is a structured data format similar to JSON. It does not inherently include executable code. However, as with any data serialization format, parsers should validate and sanitize all input to prevent code injection, memory overflows, or denial-of-service attacks.

The SCOLT format itself poses no security risks when handled properly.

Applications must ensure user-supplied .sclt files are not executed directly as code.

Interoperability considerations: SCOLT is designed for efficient storage and transmission of structured data. It can be converted to and from JSON without data loss, and thus interoperates well with existing web technologies and programming languages.

Published specification: https://github.com/possiblearyal/scolt

Applications which use this media: 

- Scolt SDK (https://www.npmjs.com/package/scolt)
- Any system supporting SCOLT-encoded structured data
- Future SCOLT-compliant libraries and data compression tools

Fragment identifier considerations: Same as JSON; fragments may refer to structural elements using JSON Pointer (RFC 6901).

Restrictions on usage: None

Additional information:

1. Deprecated alias names for this type: None
2. Magic number(s): None defined (future versions may include a header signature like “SCLT”)
3. File extension(s): .sclt
4. Macintosh file type code: TEXT
5. Object Identifiers: N/A

General Comments: SCOLT (Structured COLumnar Tabling) is a lightweight columnar data format designed to compress JSON-like structured data up to 90% smaller while maintaining reversibility and structural integrity. It emphasizes compactness, tabular layout, and parsing efficiency.
