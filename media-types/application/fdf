Media type name: application

Media subtype name: fdf

Required parameters: None

Optional parameters: None

Encoding considerations: binary

Security considerations: FDF is used to carry form and annotation 
   data in both directions, such as between a client and a server. As 
   such, its security implications are dependent on what use that 
   data is put to at both the client and the server ends. At the 
   client, the FDF data is usually combined with a PDF file and 
   presented to an end user in some form. At the server, that data 
   can be stored in databases, or fed to other applications. In all 
   cases, it is important that this data is scrutinized to prevent 
   malicious inputs from causing damage. Unlike PDF, FDF files cannot 
   be digitally signed or protected. FDF does not natively support 
   encryption. However it is possible to encrypt an entire FDF file 
   (by treating it is a binary blob) and then to embed that entire 
   encrypted blob into the EncryptedFDFs array entry of another 
   (wrapper) FDF. Encryption used by FDF for EncryptedFDFs is old and 
   limited to a weak 40-bit RC4 using MD5 hash and is thus not 
   recommended. The FDF EncryptedFDFs entry is explicitly marked as 
   deprecated from PDF 2.0 (ISO 32000-2:2020). As FDF is based on 
   PDF, it is extensible, can contain binary data or other formats - 
   see RFC 8118 for additional considerations about PDF security.

Interoperability considerations: Only a single version of FDF has 
   ever been defined, which is version 1.2 that was introduced with 
   PDF 1.2. The versioning mechanism used by FDF is the same as that 
   for PDF. As described in clause 12.7.8 of ISO 32000-2:2020, the 
   first header line of an FDF file contains the FDF version number 
   which may then be overriden by the Version key of the FDF catalog 
   dictionary, should future versions be defined. See also RFC 8118 
   for additional general considerations on PDF interoperability.

Published specification: The Forms Data Format (FDF) is defined in 
   clause 12.7.8 in "ISO 32000-2:2020. Document management - Portable 
   document format Â— Part 2: PDF 2.0": 

   https://www.iso.org/standard/75839.html.

Applications which use this media: The Forms Data Format (FDF) is a 
   file format used for interactive form and annotation data since 
   PDF 1.2. FDF can be used when submitting form data to a server, 
   receiving the response, and incorporating it into an interactive 
   form. It can also be used to export form and annotation data to 
   stand-alone files that can be stored, transmitted electronically, 
   and imported back into PDF files. FDF is entirely based on PDF - 
   it uses the same syntax and has essentially the same file layout 
   and structure.

Fragment identifier considerations: FDF itself does not have fragment 
   identifiers, but may be the target of a PDF fragment identifier. 
   Annex O of ISO 32000-2:2020 defines all PDF related fragment 
   identifiers. Table Annex O.4 defines the "fdf" PDF open parameter 
   which takes a relative or absolute URI argument to an FDF file. 
   This opens the PDF document and then imports data from the 
   specified FDF file. This information is also described 
   informatively in RFC 8118.

Restrictions on usage: None

Additional information:

   1. Deprecated alias names for this type: application/vnd.fdf
   2. Magic number(s): As per clause 12.7.8 in ISO 32000-2:2020, all 
      FDF files start with the characters "%FDF-" followed by the FDF 
      version number, e.g., "%FDF-1.2". These characters are in 
      US-ASCII encoding.
   3. File extension(s): .fdf
   4. Macintosh file type code: n/a
   5. Object Identifiers: n/a

General Comments: FDF is standardized by ISO Technical Committee 171 
   Sub-Committee 2 Working Group 8.
