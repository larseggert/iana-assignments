Media type name: application

Media subtype name: vnd.3gpp.5gnas

Required parameters: N/A

Optional parameters: N/A

Encoding considerations: binary

   The media type encodes of a 5G NAS message or information elements 
   (as defined in 3GPP TS 24.501).

Security considerations: The information transported in this media 
   type does not include active or executable content.

Mechanisms for privacy and integrity protection of protocol 
   parameters exist. Those mechanisms as well as authentication and 
   further security mechanisms are described in 3GPP TS 24.501.

Interoperability considerations: The media type allows for 
   interoperability of 5G NAS messages or information elements 
   transmitted over Service Based Interfaces (SBI).

   The 5G NAS messages or information elements are sent over SBI 
   between core network control plane entities in 5G mobile networks.
