Type name: haptics

Subtype name: hmpg

Required parameters: N/A

Optional parameters: N/A

Encoding considerations: binary

Interoperability considerations: The HMPG format is a streamable binary haptic effect coding. It is designed to enable efficient coding of temporal and spatial haptic effects. The haptic effects may target specific parts of the human body and may be associated with a reference device description allowing haptic rendering software to adapt the effects to available hardware.

Security considerations: See Section 3 of RFC-ietf-mediaman-haptics-05.

Published specification: ISO/IEC DIS 23090-31: Haptics coding [MPEG-Haptics-Coding].

Applications that use this media type: All applications that are able to create, edit, or display haptic media content.

Additional information:

File extension(s): Haptic file extensions used for HMPG files: .hmpg
Macintosh file type code(s): (no code specified)
Macintosh Universal Type Identifier code: N/A
Fragment Identifier: N/A
Deprecated Alias: N/A
