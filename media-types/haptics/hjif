Type name: haptics

Subtype name: hjif

Required parameters: N/A

Optional parameters: N/A

Encoding considerations: 8bit if UTF-8; binary if UTF-16 or UTF-32

Interoperability considerations: The HJIF format is a human-readable haptic effect coding based on the JSON format. It is designed as an interchange format for temporal and spatial haptic effects. The haptic effects may target specific parts of the human body and may be associated with a reference device description allowing haptic rendering software to adapt the effects to available hardware.

Security considerations: See Section 3 of RFC-ietf-mediaman-haptics-05.

Published specification: ISO/IEC DIS 23090-31: Haptics coding [MPEG-Haptics-Coding].

Applications that use this media type: All applications that are able to create, edit, or display haptic media content.
