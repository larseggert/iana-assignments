mls

Required parameters:

Optional parameters:
version
version:
The MLS protocol version expressed as a string <major>.<minor>. If omitted, the version is "1.0", which corresponds to MLS ProtocolVersion mls10. If for some reason the version number in the type parameter differs from the ProtocolVersion embedded in the protocol, the protocol takes precedence.

Encoding considerations:
MLS messages are represented using the TLS presentation language [RFC8446]. Therefore, MLS messages need to be treated as binary data.
