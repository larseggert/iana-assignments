Type name: video

Subtype name: FFV1

Required parameters: None.

Optional parameters: These parameters are used to signal the
   capabilities of a receiver implementation.  These parameters MUST
   NOT be used for any other purpose.

*  "version": The "version" of the FFV1 encoding as defined by
   Section 4.2.1.

*  "micro_version": The "micro_version" of the FFV1 encoding as
   defined by Section 4.2.2.

*  "coder_type": The "coder_type" of the FFV1 encoding as defined
   by Section 4.2.3.

*  "colorspace_type": The "colorspace_type" of the FFV1 encoding as
   defined by Section 4.2.5.

*  "bits_per_raw_sample": The "bits_per_raw_sample" of the FFV1
   encoding as defined by Section 4.2.7.

*  "max_slices": The value of "max_slices" is an integer indicating

Encoding considerations: This media type is defined for encapsulation
   in several audiovisual container formats and contains binary data;
   see Section 4.3.3.  This media type is framed binary data; see
   Section 4.8 of [RFC6838].

Security considerations: See Section 6 of RFC-ietf-cellar-ffv1-20.

Interoperability considerations: None.

Published specification: RFC-ietf-cellar-ffv1-20.

Applications which use this media type: Any application that requires
   the transport of lossless video can use this media type.  Some
   examples are, but not limited to screen recording, scientific
   imaging, and digital video preservation.

Fragment identifier considerations: N/A.

Additional information: None.
