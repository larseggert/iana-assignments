(registered via RFC-ietf-payload-rtp-h265-15)

Media Type name:     video

Media subtype name:  H265

Required parameters: none

OPTIONAL parameters:

profile-space, tier-flag, profile-id, profile-compatibility-
indicator, interop-constraints, and level-id:

   These parameters indicate the profile, tier, default level,
   and some constraints of the bitstream carried by the RTP
   stream and all RTP streams the RTP stream depends on, or a
   specific set of the profile, tier, default level, and some
   constraints the receiver supports.

   The profile and some constraints are indicated collectively
   by profile-space, profile-id, profile-compatibility-
   indicator, and interop-constraints.  The profile specifies
   the subset of coding tools that may have been used to
   generate the bitstream or that the receiver supports.

      Informative note: There are 32 values of profile-id, and
      there are 32 flags in profile-compatibility-indicator,
      each flag corresponding to one value of profile-id.
      According to HEVC version 1 in [HEVC], when more than
      one of the 32 flags is set for a bitstream, the
      bitstream would comply with all the profiles
      corresponding to the set flags.  However, in a draft of
      HEVC version 2 in [HEVC draft v2], subclause A.3.5, 19
      Format Range Extensions profiles have been specified,
      all using the same value of profile-id (4),
      differentiated by some of the 48 bits in interop-
      constraints - this (rather unexpected way of profile
      signalling) means that one of the 32 flags may
      correspond to multiple profiles.  To be able to support
      whatever HEVC extension profile that might be specified
      and indicated using profile-space, profile-id, profile-
      compatibility-indicator, and interop-constraints in the
      future, it would be safe to require symmetric use of
      these parameters in SDP offer/answer unless recv-sub-
      layer-id is included in the SDP answer for choosing one
      of the sub-layers offered.

   The tier is indicated by tier-flag.  The default level is
   indicated by level-id.  The tier and the default level
   specify the limits on values of syntax elements or
   arithmetic combinations of values of syntax elements that
   are followed when generating the bitstream or that the
   receiver supports.

   A set of profile-space, tier-flag, profile-id, profile-
   compatibility-indicator, interop-constraints, and level-id
   parameters ptlA is said to be consistent with another set
   of these parameters ptlB if any decoder that conforms to
   the profile, tier, level, and constraints indicated by ptlB
   can decode any bitstream that conforms to the profile,
   tier, level, and constraints indicated by ptlA.

   In SDP offer/answer, when the SDP answer does not include
   the recv-sub-layer-id parameter that is less than the
   sprop-sub-layer-id parameter in the SDP offer, the
   following applies:

      o The profile-space, tier-flag, profile-id, profile-
        compatibility-indicator, and interop-constraints
        parameters MUST be used symmetrically, i.e. the value
        of each of these parameters in the offer MUST be the
        same as that in the answer, either explicitly
        signalled or implicitly inferred.

      o The level-id parameter is changeable as long as the
        highest level indicated by the answer is either equal
        to or lower than that in the offer.  Note that the
        highest level is indicated by level-id and max-recv-
        level-id together.

   In SDP offer/answer, when the SDP answer does include the
   recv-sub-layer-id parameter that is less than the sprop-
   sub-layer-id parameter in the SDP offer, the set of
   profile-space, tier-flag, profile-id, profile-
   compatibility-indicator, interop-constraints, and level-id
   parameters included in the answer MUST be consistent with
   that for the chosen sub-layer representation as indicated
   in the SDP offer, with the exception that the level-id
   parameter in the SDP answer is changable as long as the
   highest level indicated by the answer is either lower than
   or equal to that in the offer.

   More specifications of these parameters, including how they
   relate to the values of the profile, tier, and level syntax
   elements specified in [HEVC] are provided below.

profile-space, profile-id:

   The value of profile-space MUST be in the range of 0 to 3,
   inclusive.  The value of profile-id MUST be in the range of
   0 to 31, inclusive.

   When profile-space is not present, a value of 0 MUST be
   inferred.  When profile-id is not present, a value of 1
   (i.e. the Main profile) MUST be inferred.

   When used to indicate properties of a bitstream, profile-
   space and profile-id are derived from the profile, tier,
   and level syntax elements in SPS or VPS NAL units as
   follows, where general_profile_space, general_profile_idc,
   sub_layer_profile_space[j], and sub_layer_profile_idc[j]
   are specified in [HEVC]:

      If the RTP stream is the highest RTP stream, the
      following applies:

      o profile_space = general_profile_space
      o profile_id = general_profile_idc

      Otherwise (the RTP stream is a dependee RTP stream), the
      following applies, with j being the value of the sprop-
      sub-layer-id parameter:

      o profile_space = sub_layer_profile_space[j]
      o profile_id = sub_layer_profile_idc[j]

tier-flag, level-id:

   The value of tier-flag MUST be in the range of 0 to 1,
   inclusive.  The value of level-id MUST be in the range of 0
   to 255, inclusive.

   If the tier-flag and level-id parameters are used to
   indicate properties of a bitstream, they indicate the tier
   and the highest level the bitstream complies with.

   If the tier-flag and level-id parameters are used for
   capability exchange, the following applies.  If max-recv-
   level-id is not present, the default level defined by
   level-id indicates the highest level the codec wishes to
   support.  Otherwise, max-recv-level-id indicates the
   highest level the codec supports for receiving.  For either
   receiving or sending, all levels that are lower than the
   highest level supported MUST also be supported.

   If no tier-flag is present, a value of 0 MUST be inferred
   and if no level-id is present, a value of 93 (i.e. level
   3.1) MUST be inferred.

   When used to indicate properties of a bitstream, the tier-
   flag and level-id parameters are derived from the profile,
   tier, and level syntax elements in SPS or VPS NAL units as
   follows, where general_tier_flag, general_level_idc,
   sub_layer_tier_flag[j], and sub_layer_level_idc[j] are
   specified in [HEVC]:

      If the RTP stream is the highest RTP stream, the
      following applies:

      o tier-flag = general_tier_flag
      o level-id = general_level_idc

      Otherwise (the RTP stream is a dependee RTP stream), the
      following applies, with j being the value of the sprop-
      sub-layer-id parameter:

      o tier-flag = sub_layer_tier_flag[j]
      o level-id = sub_layer_level_idc[j]

interop-constraints:

   A base16 [RFC4648] (hexadecimal) representation of six
   bytes of data, consisting of progressive_source_flag,
   interlaced_source_flag, non_packed_constraint_flag,
   frame_only_constraint_flag, and reserved_zero_44bits.

   If the interop-constraints parameter is not present, the
   following MUST be inferred:

      o progressive_source_flag = 1
      o interlaced_source_flag = 0
      o non_packed_constraint_flag = 1
      o frame_only_constraint_flag = 1
      o reserved_zero_44bits = 0

   When the interop-constraints parameter is used to indicate
   properties of a bitstream, the following applies, where
   general_progressive_source_flag,
   general_interlaced_source_flag,
   general_non_packed_constraint_flag,
   general_non_packed_constraint_flag,
   general_frame_only_constraint_flag,
   general_reserved_zero_44bits,
   sub_layer_progressive_source_flag[j],
   sub_layer_interlaced_source_flag[j],
   sub_layer_non_packed_constraint_flag[j],
   sub_layer_frame_only_constraint_flag[j], and
   sub_layer_reserved_zero_44bits[j] are specified in [HEVC]:

      If the RTP stream is the highest RTP stream, the
      following applies:

      o progressive_source_flag =
      general_progressive_source_flag
      o interlaced_source_flag =
      general_interlaced_source_flag
      o non_packed_constraint_flag =
                        general_non_packed_constraint_flag
      o frame_only_constraint_flag =
                        general_frame_only_constraint_flag
      o reserved_zero_44bits = general_reserved_zero_44bits

      Otherwise (the RTP stream is a dependee RTP stream), the
      following applies, with j being the value of the sprop-
      sub-layer-id parameter:

      o progressive_source_flag =
                        sub_layer_progressive_source_flag[j]
      o interlaced_source_flag =
                        sub_layer_interlaced_source_flag[j]
      o non_packed_constraint_flag =

         sub_layer_non_packed_constraint_flag[j]
      o frame_only_constraint_flag =

         sub_layer_frame_only_constraint_flag[j]
      o reserved_zero_44bits =
      sub_layer_reserved_zero_44bits[j]

   Using interop-constraints for capability exchange results
   in a requirement on any bitstream to be compliant with the
   interop-constraints.

profile-compatibility-indicator:

   A base16 [RFC4648] representation of four bytes of data.

   When profile-compatibility-indicator is used to indicate
   properties of a bitstream, the following applies, where
   general_profile_compatibility_flag[j] and
   sub_layer_profile_compatibility_flag[i][j] are specified in
   [HEVC]:

      The profile-compatibility-indicator in this case
      indicates additional profiles to the profile defined by
      profile_space, profile_id, and interop-constraints the
      bitstream conforms to.  A decoder that conforms to any
      of all the profiles the bitstream conforms to would be
      capable of decoding the bitstream.  These additional
      profiles are defined by profile-space, each set bit of
      profile-compatibility-indicator, and interop-
      constraints.

      If the RTP stream is the highest RTP stream, the
      following applies for each value of j in the range of 0
      to 31, inclusive:

      o bit j of profile-compatibility-indicator =
            general_profile_compatibility_flag[j]

      Otherwise (the RTP stream is a dependee RTP stream), the
      following applies for i equal to sprop-sub-layer-id and
      for each value of j in the range of 0 to 31, inclusive:

      o bit j of profile-compatibility-indicator =
            sub_layer_profile_compatibility_flag[i][j]

   Using profile-compatibility-indicator for capability
   exchange results in a requirement on any bitstream to be
   compliant with the profile-compatibility-indicator.  This
   is intended to handle cases where any future HEVC profile
   is defined as an intersection of two or more profiles.

   If this parameter is not present, this parameter defaults
   to the following: bit j, with j equal to profile-id, of
   profile-compatibility-indicator is inferred to be equal to
   1, and all other bits are inferred to be equal to 0.

sprop-sub-layer-id:

   This parameter MAY be used to indicate the highest allowed
   value of TID in the bitstream.  When not present, the value
   of sprop-sub-layer-id is inferred to be equal to 6.

   The value of sprop-sub-layer-id MUST be in the range of 0
   to 6, inclusive.

recv-sub-layer-id:

   This parameter MAY be used to signal a receiver's choice of
   the offered or declared sub-layer representations in the
   sprop-vps.  The value of recv-sub-layer-id indicates the
   TID of the highest sub-layer of the bitstream that a
   receiver supports.  When not present, the value of recv-
   sub-layer-id is inferred to be equal to the value of the
   sprop-sub-layer-id parameter in the SDP offer.

   The value of recv-sub-layer-id MUST be in the range of 0 to
   6, inclusive.

max-recv-level-id:

   This parameter MAY be used to indicate the highest level a
   receiver supports.  The highest level the receiver supports
   is equal to the value of max-recv-level-id divided by 30.

   The value of max-recv-level-id MUST be in the range of 0
   to 255, inclusive.

   When max-recv-level-id is not present, the value is
   inferred to be equal to level-id.

   max-recv-level-id MUST NOT be present when the highest
   level the receiver supports is not higher than the default
   level.

tx-mode:

   This parameter indicates whether the transmission mode is
   SRST, MRST, or MRMT.

   The value of tx-mode MUST be equal to "SRST", "MRST" or
   "MRMT".  When not present, the value of tx-mode is inferred
   to be equal to "SRST".

   If the value is equal to "MRST", MRST MUST be in use.
   Otherwise, if the value is equal to "MRMT", MRMT MUST be in
   use.  Otherwise (the value is equal to "SRST"), SRST MUST
   be in use.

   The value of tx-mode MUST be equal to "MRST" for all RTP
   streams in an MRST.

   The value of tx-mode MUST be equal to "MRMT" for all RTP
   streams in an MRMT.

sprop-vps:

   This parameter MAY be used to convey any video parameter
   set NAL unit of the bitstream for out-of-band transmission
   of video parameter sets.  The parameter MAY also be used
   for capability exchange and to indicate sub-stream
   characteristics (i.e. properties of sub-layer
   representations as defined in [HEVC]).  The value of the
   parameter is a comma-separated (',') list of base64
   [RFC4648] representations of the video parameter set NAL
   units as specified in Section 7.3.2.1 of [HEVC].

   The sprop-vps parameter MAY contain one or more than one
   video parameter set NAL unit. However, all other video
   parameter sets contained in the sprop-vps parameter MUST be
   consistent with the first video parameter set in the sprop-
   vps parameter.  A video parameter set vpsB is said to be
   consistent with another video parameter set vpsA if any
   decoder that conforms to the profile, tier, level, and
   constraints indicated by the 12 bytes of data starting from
   the syntax element general_profile_space to the syntax
   element general_level_id, inclusive, in the first
   profile_tier_level( ) syntax structure in vpsA can decode
   any bitstream that conforms to the profile, tier, level,
   and constraints indicated by the 12 bytes of data starting
   from the syntax element general_profile_space to the syntax
   element general_level_id, inclusive, in the first
   profile_tier_level( ) syntax structure in vpsB.

sprop-sps:

   This parameter MAY be used to convey sequence parameter set
   NAL units of the bitstream for out-of-band transmission of
   sequence parameter sets.  The value of the parameter is a
   comma-separated (',') list of base64 [RFC4648]
   representations of the sequence parameter set NAL units as
   specified in Section 7.3.2.2 of [HEVC].

sprop-pps:

   This parameter MAY be used to convey picture parameter set
   NAL units of the bitstream for out-of-band transmission of
   picture parameter sets.  The value of the parameter is a
   comma-separated (',') list of base64 [RFC4648]
   representations of the picture parameter set NAL units as
   specified in Section 7.3.2.3 of [HEVC].

sprop-sei:

   This parameter MAY be used to convey one or more SEI
   messages that describe bitstream characteristics.  When
   present, a decoder can rely on the bitstream
   characteristics that are described in the SEI messages for
   the entire duration of the session, independently from the
   persistence scopes of the SEI messages as specified in
   [HEVC].

   The value of the parameter is a comma-separated (',') list
   of base64 [RFC4648] representations of SEI NAL units as
   specified in Section 7.3.2.4 of [HEVC].

      Informative note: Intentionally, no list of applicable
      or inapplicable SEI messages is specified here.
      Conveying certain SEI messages in sprop-sei may be
      sensible in some application scenarios and meaningless
      in others.  However, a few examples are described below:

     1) In an environment where the bitstream was created
         from film-based source material, and no splicing is
         going to occur during the lifetime of the session,
         the film grain characteristics SEI message or the
         tone mapping information SEI message are likely
         meaningful, and sending them in sprop-sei rather than
         in the bitstream at each entry point may help saving
         bits and allows to configure the renderer only once,
         avoiding unwanted artifacts.
     2) The structure of pictures information SEI message in
         sprop-sei can be used to inform a decoder of
         information on the NAL unit types, picture order
         count values, and prediction dependencies of a
         sequence of pictures.  Having such knowledge can be
         helpful for error recovery.
     3) Examples for SEI messages that would be meaningless
         to be conveyed in sprop-sei include the decoded
         picture hash SEI message (it is close to impossible
         that all decoded pictures have the same hash-tag),
         the display orientation SEI message when the device
         is a handheld device (as the display orientation may
         change when the handheld device is turned around), or
         the filler payload SEI message (as there is no point
         in just having more bits in SDP).

max-lsr, max-lps, max-cpb, max-dpb, max-br, max-tr, max-tc:

   These parameters MAY be used to signal the capabilities of
   a receiver implementation.  These parameters MUST NOT be
   used for any other purpose.  The highest level (specified
   by max-recv-level-id) MUST be the highest that the receiver
   is fully capable of supporting.  max-lsr, max-lps, max-cpb,
   max-dpb, max-br, max-tr, and max-tc MAY be used to indicate
   capabilities of the receiver that extend the required
   capabilities of the highest level, as specified below.

   When more than one parameter from the set (max-lsr, max-
   lps, max-cpb, max-dpb, max-br, max-tr, max-tc) is present,
   the receiver MUST support all signaled capabilities
   simultaneously.  For example, if both max-lsr and max-br
   are present, the highest level with the extension of both
   the picture rate and bitrate is supported.  That is, the
   receiver is able to decode bitstreams in which the luma
   sample rate is up to max-lsr (inclusive), the bitrate is up
   to max-br (inclusive), the coded picture buffer size is
   derived as specified in the semantics of the max-br
   parameter below, and the other properties comply with the
   highest level specified by max-recv-level-id.

      Informative note: When the OPTIONAL media type
      parameters are used to signal the properties of a
      bitstream, and max-lsr, max-lps, max-cpb, max-dpb, max-
      br, max-tr, and max-tc are not present, the values of
      profile-space, tier-flag, profile-id, profile-
      compatibility-indicator, interop-constraints, and level-
      id must always be such that the bitstream complies fully
      with the specified profile, tier, and level.

max-lsr:
   The value of max-lsr is an integer indicating the maximum
   processing rate in units of luma samples per second.  The
   max-lsr parameter signals that the receiver is capable of
   decoding video at a higher rate than is required by the
   highest level.

   When max-lsr is signaled, the receiver MUST be able to
   decode bitstreams that conform to the highest level, with
   the exception that the MaxLumaSR value in Table A-2 of
   [HEVC] for the highest level is replaced with the value of
   max-lsr.  Senders MAY use this knowledge to send pictures
   of a given size at a higher picture rate than is indicated
   in the highest level.

   When not present, the value of max-lsr is inferred to be
   equal to the value of MaxLumaSR given in Table A-2 of
   [HEVC] for the highest level.

   The value of max-lsr MUST be in the range of MaxLumaSR to
   16 * MaxLumaSR, inclusive, where MaxLumaSR is given in
   Table A-2 of [HEVC] for the highest level.

max-lps:
   The value of max-lps is an integer indicating the maximum
   picture size in units of luma samples.  The max-lps
   parameter signals that the receiver is capable of decoding
   larger picture sizes than are required by the highest
   level.  When max-lps is signaled, the receiver MUST be able
   to decode bitstreams that conform to the highest level,
   with the exception that the MaxLumaPS value in Table A-1 of
   [HEVC] for the highest level is replaced with the value of
   max-lps.  Senders MAY use this knowledge to send larger
   pictures at a proportionally lower picture rate than is
   indicated in the highest level.

   When not present, the value of max-lps is inferred to be
   equal to the value of MaxLumaPS given in Table A-1 of
   [HEVC] for the highest level.

   The value of max-lps MUST be in the range of MaxLumaPS to
   16 * MaxLumaPS, inclusive, where MaxLumaPS is given in
   Table A-1 of [HEVC] for the highest level.

max-cpb:
   The value of max-cpb is an integer indicating the maximum
   coded picture buffer size in units of CpbBrVclFactor bits
   for the VCL HRD parameters and in units of CpbBrNalFactor
   bits for the NAL HRD parameters, where CpbBrVclFactor and
   CpbBrNalFactor are defined in Section A.4 of [HEVC].  The
   max-cpb parameter signals that the receiver has more memory
   than the minimum amount of coded picture buffer memory
   required by the highest level.  When max-cpb is signaled,
   the receiver MUST be able to decode bitstreams that conform
   to the highest level, with the exception that the MaxCPB
   value in Table A-1 of [HEVC] for the highest level is
   replaced with the value of max-cpb.  Senders MAY use this
   knowledge to construct coded bitstreams with greater
   variation of bitrate than can be achieved with the MaxCPB
   value in Table A-1 of [HEVC].

   When not present, the value of max-cpb is inferred to be
   equal to the value of MaxCPB given in Table A-1 of [HEVC]
   for the highest level.

   The value of max-cpb MUST be in the range of MaxCPB to
   16 * MaxCPB, inclusive, where MaxLumaCPB is given in Table
   A-1 of [HEVC] for the highest level.

      Informative note: The coded picture buffer is used in
      the hypothetical reference decoder (Annex C of HEVC).
      The use of the hypothetical reference decoder is
      recommended in HEVC encoders to verify that the produced
      bitstream conforms to the standard and to control the
      output bitrate.  Thus, the coded picture buffer is
      conceptually independent of any other potential buffers
      in the receiver, including de-packetization and de-
      jitter buffers.  The coded picture buffer need not be
      implemented in decoders as specified in Annex C of HEVC,
      but rather standard-compliant decoders can have any
      buffering arrangements provided that they can decode
      standard-compliant bitstreams.  Thus, in practice, the
      input buffer for a video decoder can be integrated with
      de-packetization and de-jitter buffers of the receiver.

   max-dpb:
   The value of max-dpb is an integer indicating the maximum
   decoded picture buffer size in units decoded pictures at
   the MaxLumaPS for the highest level, i.e. the number of
   decoded pictures at the maximum picture size defined by the
   highest level.  The value of max-dpb MUST be in the range
   of 1 to 16, respectively.  The max-dpb parameter signals
   that the receiver has more memory than the minimum amount
   of decoded picture buffer memory required by default, which
   is MaxDpbPicBuf as defined in [HEVC] (equal to 6).  When
   max-dpb is signaled, the receiver MUST be able to decode
   bitstreams that conform to the highest level, with the
   exception that the MaxDpbPicBuff value defined in [HEVC] as
   6 is replaced with the value of max-dpb.  Consequently, a
   receiver that signals max-dpb MUST be capable of storing
   the following number of decoded pictures (MaxDpbSize) in
   its decoded picture buffer:

     if( PicSizeInSamplesY <= ( MaxLumaPS >> 2 ) )
        MaxDpbSize = Min( 4 * max-dpb, 16 )
     else if ( PicSizeInSamplesY <= ( MaxLumaPS >> 1 ) )
        MaxDpbSize = Min( 2 * max-dpb, 16 )
     else if ( PicSizeInSamplesY <= ( ( 3 * MaxLumaPS ) >> 2
   ) )
        MaxDpbSize = Min( (4 * max-dpb) / 3, 16 )
     else
        MaxDpbSize = max-dpb

   Wherein MaxLumaPS given in Table A-1 of [HEVC] for the
   highest level and PicSizeInSamplesY is the current size of
   each decoded picture in units of luma samples as defined in
   [HEVC].

   The value of max-dpb MUST be greater than or equal to the
   value of MaxDpbPicBuf (i.e. 6) as defined in [HEVC].
   Senders MAY use this knowledge to construct coded
   bitstreams with improved compression.

   When not present, the value of max-dpb is inferred to be
   equal to the value of MaxDpbPicBuf (i.e. 6) as defined in
   [HEVC].

      Informative note: This parameter was added primarily to
      complement a similar codepoint in the ITU-T
      Recommendation H.245, so as to facilitate signaling
      gateway designs.  The decoded picture buffer stores
      reconstructed samples.  There is no relationship between
      the size of the decoded picture buffer and the buffers
      used in RTP, especially de-packetization and de-jitter
      buffers.

max-br:
   The value of max-br is an integer indicating the maximum
   video bitrate in units of CpbBrVclFactor bits per second
   for the VCL HRD parameters and in units of CpbBrNalFactor
   bits per second for the NAL HRD parameters, where
   CpbBrVclFactor and CpbBrNalFactor are defined in Section
   A.4 of [HEVC].

   The max-br parameter signals that the video decoder of the
   receiver is capable of decoding video at a higher bitrate
   than is required by the highest level.

   When max-br is signaled, the video codec of the receiver
   MUST be able to decode bitstreams that conform to the
   highest level, with the following exceptions in the limits
   specified by the highest level:

    o The value of max-br replaces the MaxBR value in Table A-
      2 of [HEVC] for the highest level.
    o When the max-cpb parameter is not present, the result of
      the following formula replaces the value of MaxCPB in
      Table A-1 of [HEVC]:

         (MaxCPB of the highest level) * max-br / (MaxBR of
         the highest level)

   For example, if a receiver signals capability for Main
   profile Level 2 with max-br equal to 2000, this indicates a
   maximum video bitrate of 2000 kbits/sec for VCL HRD
   parameters, a maximum video bitrate of 2200 kbits/sec for
   NAL HRD parameters, and a CPB size of 2000000 bits (2000000
   / 1500000 * 1500000).

   Senders MAY use this knowledge to send higher bitrate video
   as allowed in the level definition of Annex A of HEVC to
   achieve improved video quality.

   When not present, the value of max-br is inferred to be
   equal to the value of MaxBR given in Table A-2 of [HEVC]
   for the highest level.

   The value of max-br MUST be in the range of MaxBR to
   16 * MaxBR, inclusive, where MaxBR is given in Table A-2 of
   [HEVC] for the highest level.

      Informative note: This parameter was added primarily to
      complement a similar codepoint in the ITU-T
      Recommendation H.245, so as to facilitate signaling
      gateway designs.  The assumption that the network is
      capable of handling such bitrates at any given time
      cannot be made from the value of this parameter.  In
      particular, no conclusion can be drawn that the signaled
      bitrate is possible under congestion control
      constraints.

max-tr:
   The value of max-tr is an integer indication the maximum
   number of tile rows.  The max-tr parameter signals that the
   receiver is capable of decoding video with a larger number
   of tile rows than the value allowed by the highest level.

   When max-tr is signaled, the receiver MUST be able to
   decode bitstreams that conform to the highest level, with
   the exception that the MaxTileRows value in Table A-1 of
   [HEVC] for the highest level is replaced with the value of
   max-tr.

   Senders MAY use this knowledge to send pictures utilizing a
   larger number of tile rows than the value allowed by the
   highest level.

   When not present, the value of max-tr is inferred to be
   equal to the value of MaxTileRows given in Table A-1 of
   [HEVC] for the highest level.

   The value of max-tr MUST be in the range of MaxTileRows to
   16 * MaxTileRows, inclusive, where MaxTileRows is given in
   Table A-1 of [HEVC] for the highest level.

max-tc:
   The value of max-tc is an integer indication the maximum
   number of tile columns.  The max-tc parameter signals that
   the receiver is capable of decoding video with a larger
   number of tile columns than the value allowed by the
   highest level.

   When max-tc is signaled, the receiver MUST be able to
   decode bitstreams that conform to the highest level, with
   the exception that the MaxTileCols value in Table A-1 of
   [HEVC] for the highest level is replaced with the value of
   max-tc.

   Senders MAY use this knowledge to send pictures utilizing a
   larger number of tile columns than the value allowed by the
   highest level.

   When not present, the value of max-tc is inferred to be
   equal to the value of MaxTileCols given in Table A-1 of
   [HEVC] for the highest level.

   The value of max-tc MUST be in the range of MaxTileCols to
   16 * MaxTileCols, inclusive, where MaxTileCols is given in
   Table A-1 of [HEVC] for the highest level.

max-fps:

   The value of max-fps is an integer indicating the maximum
   picture rate in units of pictures per 100 seconds that can
   be effectively processed by the receiver.  The max-fps
   parameter MAY be used to signal that the receiver has a
   constraint in that it is not capable of processing video
   effectively at the full picture rate that is implied by the
   highest level and, when present, one or more of the
   parameters max-lsr, max-lps, and max-br.

   The value of max-fps is not necessarily the picture rate at
   which the maximum picture size can be sent, it constitutes
   a constraint on maximum picture rate for all resolutions.

      Informative note: The max-fps parameter is semantically
      different from max-lsr, max-lps, max-cpb, max-dpb, max-
      br, max-tr, and max-tc in that max-fps is used to signal
      a constraint, lowering the maximum picture rate from
      what is implied by other parameters.

   The encoder MUST use a picture rate equal to or less than
   this value.  In cases where the max-fps parameter is absent
   the encoder is free to choose any picture rate according to
   the highest level and any signaled optional parameters.

   The value of max-fps MUST be smaller than or equal to the
   full picture rate that is implied by the highest level and,
   when present, one or more of the parameters max-lsr, max-
   lps, and max-br.

sprop-max-don-diff:

   If tx-mode is equal to "SRST" and there is no NAL unit
   naluA that is followed in transmission order by any NAL
   unit preceding naluA in decoding order (i.e. the
   transmission order of the NAL units is the same as the
   decoding order), the value of this parameter MUST be equal
   to 0.

   Otherwise, if tx-mode is equal to "MRST" or "MRMT", the
   decoding order of the NAL units of all the RTP streams is
   the same as the NAL unit transmission order and the NAL
   unit output order, the value of this parameter MUST be
   equal to either 0 or 1.

   Otherwise, if tx-mode is equal to "MRST" or "MRMT" and the
   decoding order of the NAL units of all the RTP streams is
   the same as the NAL unit transmission order but not the
   same as the NAL unit output order, the value of this
   parameter MUST be equal to 1.

   Otherwise, this parameter specifies the maximum absolute
   difference between the decoding order number (i.e., AbsDon)
   values of any two NAL units naluA and naluB, where naluA
   follows naluB in decoding order and precedes naluB in
   transmission order.

   The value of sprop-max-don-diff MUST be an integer in the
   range of 0 to 32767, inclusive.

   When not present, the value of sprop-max-don-diff is
   inferred to be equal to 0.

sprop-depack-buf-nalus:

   This parameter specifies the maximum number of NAL units
   that precede a NAL unit in transmission order and follow
   the NAL unit in decoding order.

   The value of sprop-depack-buf-nalus MUST be an integer in
   the range of 0 to 32767, inclusive.

   When not present, the value of sprop-depack-buf-nalus is
   inferred to be equal to 0.

   When sprop-max-don-diff is present and greater than 0, this
   parameter MUST be present and the value MUST be greater
   than 0.

sprop-depack-buf-bytes:

   This parameter signals the required size of the de-
   packetization buffer in units of bytes.  The value of the
   parameter MUST be greater than or equal to the maximum
   buffer occupancy (in units of bytes) of the de-
   packetization buffer as specified in Section 6.

   The value of sprop-depack-buf-bytes MUST be an integer in
   the range of 0 to 4294967295, inclusive.

   When sprop-max-don-diff is present and greater than 0, this
   parameter MUST be present and the value MUST be greater
   than 0. When not present, the value of sprop-depack-buf-
   bytes is inferred to be equal to 0.

      Informative note: The value of sprop-depack-buf-bytes
      indicates the required size of the de-packetization
      buffer only.  When network jitter can occur, an
      appropriately sized jitter buffer has to be available as
      well.

depack-buf-cap:

   This parameter signals the capabilities of a receiver
   implementation and indicates the amount of de-packetization
   buffer space in units of bytes that the receiver has
   available for reconstructing the NAL unit decoding order
   from NAL units carried in one or more RTP streams.  A
   receiver is able to handle any RTP stream, and all RTP
   streams the RTP stream depends on, when present, for which
   the value of the sprop-depack-buf-bytes parameter is
   smaller than or equal to this parameter.

   When not present, the value of depack-buf-cap is inferred
   to be equal to 4294967295.  The value of depack-buf-cap
   MUST be an integer in the range of 1 to 4294967295,
   inclusive.

      Informative note: depack-buf-cap indicates the maximum
      possible size of the de-packetization buffer of the
      receiver only, without allowing for network jitter.

sprop-segmentation-id:

   This parameter MAY be used to signal the segmentation tools
   present in the bitstream and that can be used for
   parallelization.  The value of sprop-segmentation-id MUST
   be an integer in the range of 0 to 3, inclusive.  When not
   present, the value of sprop-segmentation-id is inferred to
   be equal to 0.

   When sprop-segmentation-id is equal to 0, no information
   about the segmentation tools is provided.  When sprop-
   segmentation-id is equal to 1, it indicates that slices are
   present in the bitstream.  When sprop-segmentation-id is
   equal to 2, it indicates that tiles are present in the
   bitstream.  When sprop-segmentation-id is equal to 3, it
   indicates that WPP is used in the bitstream.

sprop-spatial-segmentation-idc:

   A base16 [RFC4648] representation of the syntax element
   min_spatial_segmentation_idc as specified in [HEVC].  This
   parameter MAY be used to describe parallelization
   capabilities of the bitstream.

dec-parallel-cap:

   This parameter MAY be used to indicate the decoder's
   additional decoding capabilities given the presence of
   tools enabling parallel decoding, such as slices, tiles,
   and WPP, in the bitstream.  The decoding capability of the
   decoder may vary with the setting of the parallel decoding
   tools present in the bitstream, e.g. the size of the tiles
   that are present in a bitstream.  Therefore, multiple
   capability points may be provided, each indicating the
   minimum required decoding capability that is associated
   with a parallelism requirement, which is a requirement on
   the bitstream that enables parallel decoding.

   Each capability point is defined as a combination of 1) a
   parallelism requirement, 2) a profile (determined by
   profile-space and profile-id), 3) a highest level, and 4) a
   maximum processing rate, a maximum picture size, and a
   maximum video bitrate that may be equal to or greater than
   that determined by the highest level.  The parameter's
   syntax in ABNF [RFC5234] is as follows:

      dec-parallel-cap = "dec-parallel-cap={" cap-point *(","
                         cap-point) "}"

      cap-point = ("w" / "t") ":" spatial-seg-idc 1*(";"
                   cap-parameter)

      spatial-seg-idc = 1*4DIGIT ; (1-4095)

      cap-parameter = tier-flag / level-id / max-lsr
                      / max-lps / max-br

      tier-flag = "tier-flag" EQ ("0" / "1")

      level-id  = "level-id" EQ 1*3DIGIT ; (0-255)

      max-lsr   = "max-lsr" EQ  1*20DIGIT ; (0-
      18,446,744,073,709,551,615)

      max-lps   = "max-lps" EQ 1*10DIGIT ; (0-4,294,967,295)

      max-br    = "max-br"  EQ 1*20DIGIT ; (0-
      18,446,744,073,709,551,615)

      EQ = "="

   The set of capability points expressed by the dec-parallel-
   cap parameter is enclosed in a pair of curly braces ("{}").
   Each set of two consecutive capability points is separated
   by a comma (',').  Within each capability point, each set
   of two consecutive parameters, and when present, their
   values, is separated by a semicolon (';').

   The profile of all capability points is determined by
   profile-space and profile-id that are outside the dec-
   parallel-cap parameter.

   Each capability point starts with an indication of the
   parallelism requirement, which consists of a parallel tool
   type, which may be equal to 'w' or 't', and a decimal value
   of the spatial-seg-idc parameter.  When the type is 'w',
   the capability point is valid only for H.265 bitstreams
   with WPP in use, i.e. entropy_coding_sync_enabled_flag
   equal to 1.  When the type is 't', the capability point is
   valid only for H.265 bitstreams with WPP not in use (i.e.
   entropy_coding_sync_enabled_flag equal to 0).  The
   capability-point is valid only for H.265 bitstreams with
   min_spatial_segmentation_idc equal to or greater than
   spatial-seg-idc.

   After the parallelism requirement indication, each
   capability point continues with one or more pairs of
   parameter and value in any order for any of the following
   parameters:

      o tier-flag
      o level-id
      o max-lsr
      o max-lps
      o max-br

   At most one occurrence of each of the above five parameters
   is allowed within each capability point.

   The values of dec-parallel-cap.tier-flag and dec-parallel-
   cap.level-id for a capability point indicate the highest
   level of the capability point.  The values of dec-parallel-
   cap.max-lsr, dec-parallel-cap.max-lps, and dec-parallel-
   cap.max-br for a capability point indicate the maximum
   processing rate in units of luma samples per second, the
   maximum picture size in units of luma samples, and the
   maximum video bitrate (in units of CpbBrVclFactor bits per
   second for the VCL HRD parameters and in units of
   CpbBrNalFactor bits per second for the NAL HRD parameters
   where CpbBrVclFactor and CpbBrNalFactor are defined in
   Section A.4 of [HEVC]).

   When not present, the value of dec-parallel-cap.tier-flag
   is inferred to be equal to the value of tier-flag outside
   the dec-parallel-cap parameter.  When not present, the
   value of dec-parallel-cap.level-id is inferred to be equal
   to the value of max-recv-level-id outside the dec-parallel-
   cap parameter.  When not present, the value of dec-
   parallel-cap.max-lsr, dec-parallel-cap.max-lps, or dec-
   parallel-cap.max-br is inferred to be equal to the value of
   max-lsr, max-lps, or max-br, respectively, outside the dec-
   parallel-cap parameter.

   The general decoding capability, expressed by the set of
   parameters outside of dec-parallel-cap, is defined as the
   capability point that is determined by the following
   combination of parameters: 1) the parallelism requirement
   corresponding to the value of sprop-segmentation-id equal
   to 0 for a bitstream, 2) the profile determined by profile-
   space, profile-id, profile-compatibility-indicator, and
   interop-constraints, 3) the tier and the highest level
   determined by tier-flag and max-recv-level-id, and 4) the
   maximum processing rate, the maximum picture size, and the
   maximum video bitrate determined by the highest level.  The
   general decoding capability MUST NOT be included as one of
   the set of capability points in the dec-parallel-cap
   parameter.

   For example, the following parameters express the general
   decoding capability of 720p30 (Level 3.1) plus an
   additional decoding capability of 1080p30 (Level 4) given
   that the spatially largest tile or slice used in the
   bitstream is equal to or less than 1/3 of the picture size:

      a=fmtp:98 level-id=93;dec-parallel-cap={t:8;level-
      id=120}

   For another example, the following parameters express an
   additional decoding capability of 1080p30, using dec-
   parallel-cap.max-lsr and dec-parallel-cap.max-lps, given
   that WPP is used in the bitstream:

      a=fmtp:98 level-id=93;dec-parallel-cap={w:8;
                  max-lsr=62668800;max-lps=2088960}

      Informative note: When min_spatial_segmentation_idc is
      present in a bitstream and WPP is not used, [HEVC]
      specifies that there is no slice or no tile in the
      bitstream containing more than 4 * PicSizeInSamplesY /
      ( min_spatial_segmentation_idc + 4 ) luma samples.

include-dph:

   This parameter is used to indicate the capability and
   preference to utilize or include decoded picture hash (DPH)
   SEI messages (See Section D.3.19 of [HEVC]) in the
   bitstream. DPH SEI messages can be used to detect picture
   corruption so the receiver can request picture repair, see
   Section 8.  The value is a comma separated list of hash
   types that is supported or requested to be used, each hash
   type provided as an unsigned integer value (0-255), with
   the hash types listed from most preferred to the least
   preferred.  Example: "include-dph=0,2", which indicates the
   capability for MD5 (most preferred) and Checksum (less
   preferred).  If the parameter is not included or the value
   contains no hash types, then no capability to utilize DPH
   SEI messages is assumed.  Note that DPH SEI messages MAY
   still be included in the bitstream even when there is no
   declaration of capability to use them, as in general SEI
   messages do not affect the normative decoding process and
   decoders are allowed to ignore SEI messages.

   This type is only defined for transfer via RTP (RFC 3550).
