Media type name: video

Media subtype name: lottie+json

Required parameters: N/A

Optional parameters: N/A

Encoding considerations: binary

JSON based, but generally expected to be UTF-8 encoded text

Security considerations: Security considerations relating to the generation and consumption of Lottie files are similar to application/json and are discussed in Section 12 of [RFC8259].

Documents may reference external image assets. Security considerations in the Media Type registrations for those formats shall apply.

A commonly used extension to the format outside of the spec is "expressions" which allow code execution. In itself, the Lottie format is a text based json document and relatively harmless. Support for expressions and security considerations for the same are dependent on the renderer used.

Interoperability considerations: Processors must expect that content received is well-formed JSON, but it cannot be guaranteed that the content is valid to a particular Schema version, or that the processor will recognize all of the elements and attributes in the document.

Published specification: The specification is published by Lottie Animation Community, and is publicly available at
