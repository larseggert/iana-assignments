Media type name: video

Media subtype name: vnd.blockfact.factv

Required parameters: 

version: Specifies the version of the .factv format (e.g., 1.0)
content-type: MIME type of the wrapped video (e.g., video/mp4)
blockchain-id: Blockchain transaction ID or contract reference
checksum: Hash to verify integrity (e.g., SHA-256)
encryption-key: Identifier for the decryption key

Optional parameters: 

encryption: Encryption type for metadata (e.g., AES256)
compression: Indicates if video content is compressed (true/false)
duration: Media length (e.g., 00:04:20)
title: Title of the video
creator: Creator of the content
description: Textual description of the content

Encoding considerations: binary

Security considerations: Metadata may be encrypted for confidentiality.

Checksum and blockchain reference ensure authenticity and prevent tampering.

Transport over secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS) is recommended.

Interoperability considerations: Lite systems may play the video without verifying metadata.

Full systems can decrypt metadata and verify authenticity.

Published specification: https://blockfact.io/specifications/factv.txt

Applications which use this media: BlockFact Video Verification Tools, blockchain-integrated video players, authenticated video distribution platforms.

Fragment identifier considerations: N/A

Restrictions on usage: .factv files should not be used in environments or protocols where metadata integrity could be lost or manipulated:

- Transmission over unsecured channels (e.g., HTTP, FTP) is discouraged.
- Legacy file systems that strip custom metadata may cause verification failure.
- Automated pipelines that alter file headers or inject new metadata may invalidate verification.
- Offline environments without blockchain access cannot validate authenticity.
