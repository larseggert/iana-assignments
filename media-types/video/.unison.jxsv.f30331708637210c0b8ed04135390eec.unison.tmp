Type name:  video

Subtype name:  jxsv

Clock rate:  90000

Required parameters:

  rate:  The RTP timestamp clock rate.  Applications using this
     payload format SHALL use a value of 90000.

  packetmode:  This parameter specifies the configured packetization
     mode as defined by the pacKetization mode (K) bit in the
     payload header of Section 4.3 of RFC-ietf-payload-rtp-jpegxs-18.  
     This value SHALL be equal to the K bit value configured in the 
     RTP stream (i.e. 0 for codestream or 1 for slice).

Optional parameters:

  transmode:  This parameter specifies the configured transmission
     mode as defined by the Transmission mode (T) bit in the payload
     header of Section 4.3 of RFC-ietf-payload-rtp-jpegxs-18.  If 
     specified, this value SHALL be equal to the T bit value 
     configured in the RTP stream (i.e. 0 for out-of-order-allowed 
     or 1 for sequential-only).  If not specified, a value 1 
     (sequential-only) SHALL be assumed and the T bit SHALL be set 
     to 1.

  profile:  The JPEG XS profile [ISO21122-2] in use.  Any white
     space in the profile name SHALL be omitted.  Examples of valid
     profile names are 'Main444.12' or 'High444.12'.

  level:  The JPEG XS level [ISO21122-2] in use.  Any white space in
     the level name SHALL be omitted.  Examples of valid levels are
     '2k-1' or '4k-2'.

  sublevel:  The JPEG XS sublevel [ISO21122-2] in use.  Any white
     space in the sublevel name SHALL be omitted.  Examples of valid
     sublevels are 'Sublev3bpp' or 'Sublev6bpp'.

  depth:  Determines the number of bits per sample.  This is an
     integer with typical values including 8, 10, 12, and 16.

  width:  Determines the number of pixels per line.  This is an
     integer between 1 and 32767 inclusive.

  height:  Determines the number of lines per video frame.  This is
     an integer between 1 and 32767 inclusive.

  exactframerate:  Signals the video frame rate in frames per
     second.  Integer frame rates SHALL be signaled as a single
     decimal number (e.g. "25") whilst non-integer frame rates SHALL
     be signaled as a ratio of two integer decimal numbers separated
     by a "forward-slash" character (e.g. "30000/1001"), utilizing
     the numerically smallest numerator value possible.

  interlace:  If this parameter name is present, it indicates that
     the video is interlaced, or that the video is Progressive
     segmented Frame (PsF).  If this parameter name is not present,
     the progressive video format SHALL be assumed.

  segmented:  If this parameter name is present, and the interlace
     parameter name is also present, then the video is a Progressive
     segmented Frame (PsF).  Signaling of this parameter without the

  TCS:  Transfer Characteristic System.  This parameter specifies
     the transfer characteristic system of the image samples.  Valid
     values and their specification are:

        SDR          Standard Dynamic Range video streams that
                     utilize the OETF of ITU-R Recommendation
                     BT.709 or ITU-R Recommendation BT.2020. Such
                     streams SHALL be assumed to target the EOTF
                     specified in ITU-R Recommendation BT.1886.

                     are signaled by the payload as specified in
                     [ISO21122-3], or must be manually
                     coordinated between sender and receiver.

  RANGE:  This parameter SHOULD be used to signal the encoding range
     of the sample values within the stream.  When paired with ITU
     Rec BT.2100 colorimetry, this parameter has two allowed values
     NARROW and FULL, corresponding to the ranges specified in table
     9 of ITU Rec BT.2100.  In any other context, this parameter has
     three allowed values: NARROW, FULLPROTECT, and FULL, which
     correspond to the ranges specified in SMPTE RP 2077.  In the
     absence of this parameter, and for all but the UNSPECIFIED
     colorimetry, NARROW SHALL be the assumed value.  When paired
     with the UNSPECIFIED colorimetry, FULL SHALL be the default
     assumed value.
