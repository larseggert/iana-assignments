Type name:  text

Subtype name:  ecmascript

Required parameters:  N/A

Optional parameters:  charset.  See Section 4.1 of RFC 9239.

Encoding considerations:  Binary

Security considerations:  See Section 5 of RFC 9239.

Interoperability considerations:  It is expected that implementations
   will behave as if this registration applies to later editions of
   [ECMA-262], and its published specification references may be
   updated accordingly from time to time.  Although this expectation
   is unusual among media type registrations, it matches widespread
   industry conventions.  See Section 2 of RFC 9239.

Published specification:  [ECMA-262]

Applications that use this media type:  Script interpreters as
   discussed in RFC 9239.

Additional information:
   Deprecated alias names for this type:  application/ecmascript,
      application/x-ecmascript, text/x-ecmascript
   Magic number(s):  N/A
   File extension(s):  .es, .mjs
   Macintosh File Type Code(s):  TEXT

Person & email address to contact for further information:  See the
   Authors' Addresses sections of RFC 9239 and [RFC4329].

Intended usage:  OBSOLETE

Restrictions on usage:  This media type is obsolete; current
   implementations should use text/javascript as the only JavaScript/
   ECMAScript media type.  The .mjs file extension signals that the
   file represents a JavaScript module.  Execution environments that
   rely on file extensions to determine how to process inputs parse
   .mjs files using the Module grammar of [ECMA-262].

Author:  See the Authors' Addresses sections of RFC 9239 and
   [RFC4329].
