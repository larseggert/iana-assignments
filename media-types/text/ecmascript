Type name:  application

Subtype name:  ecmascript

Required parameters:  N/A

Optional parameters:  charset, see section 4.1 of RFC-ietf-dispatch-javascript-mjs-17.

Encoding considerations:  Binary

Security considerations:  See section 5 of RFC-ietf-dispatch-javascript-mjs-17.

Interoperability considerations:  It is expected that implementations
   will behave as if this registration applies to later editions of
   [ECMA-262], and its published specification references may be
   updated accordingly from time to time.  Although this expectation
   is unusual among media type registrations, it matches widespread
   industry conventions.  See section 2 of RFC-ietf-dispatch-javascript-mjs-17.

Published specification:  [ECMA-262]

Applications which use this media type:  Script interpreters as
   discussed in RFC-ietf-dispatch-javascript-mjs-17.

Additional information:

Deprecated alias names for this type:  application/ecmascript,
   application/x-ecmascript, text/x-ecmascript

Magic number(s):  n/a

File extension(s):  .es, .mjs

Macintosh File Type Code(s):  TEXT

Person & email address to contact for further information:  See
   Author's Address section of RFC-ietf-dispatch-javascript-mjs-17 
   and [RFC4329].

Intended usage:  OBSOLETE

Restrictions on usage:  This media type is obsolete; current
   implementations should use text/javascript as the only JavaScript/
   ECMAScript media type.  The .mjs file extension signals that the
   file represents a JavaScript module.  Execution environments that
   rely on file extensions to determine how to process inputs parse
   .mjs files using the Module grammar of [ECMA-262].
