Required parameters:  N/A

Optional parameters:  charset.  See Section 4.1 of RFC 9239.

Encoding considerations:  Binary

Security considerations:  See Section 5 of RFC 9239.

Interoperability considerations:  It is expected that implementations
   will behave as if this registration applies to later editions of
   [ECMA-262], and its published specification references may be
   updated accordingly from time to time.  Although this expectation
   is unusual among media type registrations, it matches widespread
   industry conventions.  See Section 2 of RFC 9239.

Published specification:  [ECMA-262]

Applications that use this media type:  Script interpreters as
   discussed in RFC 9239.

Person & email address to contact for further information:  See the
   Authors' Addresses sections of RFC 9239 and [RFC4329].

Intended usage:  COMMON

Restrictions on usage:  The .mjs file extension signals that the file
   represents a JavaScript module.  Execution environments that rely
   on file extensions to determine how to process inputs parse .mjs
   files using the Module grammar of [ECMA-262].
