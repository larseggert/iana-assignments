Type name: text

Subtype name: flexfec

Required parameters:

o  rate: The RTP timestamp (clock) rate.  The rate SHALL be larger
   than 1000 Hz to provide sufficient resolution to RTCP operations.
   However, it is RECOMMENDED to select the rate that matches the
   rate of the protected source RTP stream.

o  repair-window: The time that spans the source packets and the
   corresponding repair packets.  The size of the repair window is
   specified in microseconds.

Encoding considerations: This media type is framed (see Section 4.8
in the template document [RFC6838]) and contains binary data.

Security considerations: See Section 9 of [RFC8627].

Interoperability considerations: None.

Published specification: [RFC8627].

Applications that use this media type: Multimedia applications that
want to improve resiliency against packet loss by sending redundant
data in addition to the source media.

Fragment identifier considerations: None.

Additional information: None.

IESG <iesg&ietf.org> and IETF Audio/Video Transport Payloads Working
Group (or its successor as delegated by the IESG).

Intended usage: COMMON.

Restrictions on usage: This media type depends on RTP framing; hence,
it is only defined for transport via RTP [RFC3550].
