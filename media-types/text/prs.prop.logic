Media type name: text
Media subtype name: prs.prop.logic

Required parameters: None

Optional parameters:
None

Encoding considerations: 7bit
CRLFs are used as line breaks and only printable characters in the ASCII range with the addition of the Horizontal Tab character are meaningful.

Security considerations:
The proof in propositional logic may be incorrect or invalid. This may invalidate the security of systems that rely on the validity of such proofs.

Additional security considerations have yet to be assessed. 

Interoperability considerations:
The format is not yet formally defined or finalized. For display the horizontal tab is considered to be 8 characters wide. If the format is unparsable or the parse yields an incorrect proof, the application should fallback to display the plain text.

Published specification:
N/A
