Media type name: text

Media subtype name: wgsl

Required parameters: N/A

Optional parameters: N/A

Encoding considerations: binary

   WGSL is Unicode text using the UTF-8 encoding, with no byte order 
   mark (BOM). 

   See [WGSL] Section 3. Textual Structure.

Security considerations: WebGPU Shading Language (WGSL) is a 
   programming language for GPU code to be executed in the context of 
   the WebGPU API. For security considerations, see [WebGPU] Section 
   2.1 Security Considerations. For privacy considerations, see 
   [WebGPU] Section 2.2 Privacy Considerations.

Interoperability considerations: Implementations of WebGPU may have 
   different capabilities, and these differences may affect what 
   features may be exercised by WGSL programs. See [WebGPU] Section 
   3.6 Optional capabilities, and [WGSL] Section 11. Language 
   Extensions.

   It is expected that implementations will behave as if this 
   registration applies to later editions of WGSL, and its published 
   specification references may be updated accordingly from time to 
   time. Although this expectation is unusual among media type 
   registrations, it matches widespread industry conventions.
