(RFC 5577 published July 2009)

Media type name: audio

Media subtype name: G7221

Required parameters:

   bitrate: the data rate for the audio bit stream.  This parameter
   is mandatory because the bit rate is not signaled within the
   G.722.1 bit stream.  At the standard G.722.1 bit rates, the value
   MUST be either 24000 or 32000 at 16 Khz sample rate, and 24000,
   32000, or 48000 at 32 Khz sample rate.  If using the non-standard
   bit rates, then it is RECOMMENDED that values in the range 16000
   to 48000 be used.  Non-standard rates MUST have a value that is a
   multiple of 400 (this maintains octet alignment and does not then
   require (undefined) padding bits for each frame if not octet
   aligned).

Optional parameters:

   rate: RTP timestamp clock rate, which is equal to the sampling
   rate.  If the parameter is not specified, a clock rate of 16 Khz
   is assumed.

   ptime: see RFC 8866.  SHOULD be a multiple of 20 ms.

   maxptime: see RFC 8866.  SHOULD be a multiple of 20 ms.

Encoding considerations:

   This media type is framed and binary, see Section 4.8 in
   [RFC4288].

Security considerations: See Section 6

Interoperability considerations:

   Terminals SHOULD offer a media type at 16 Khz sample rate in order
   to interoperate with terminals that do not support the new 32 Khz
   sample rate.

Published specification: RFC 5577.

Applications that use this media type:

   Audio and Video streaming and conferencing applications.

Additional information: none

Intended usage: COMMON

Restrictions on usage:

   This media type depends on RTP framing, and hence is only defined
   for transfer via RTP [RFC3550].  Transport within other framing
   protocols is not defined at this time.
