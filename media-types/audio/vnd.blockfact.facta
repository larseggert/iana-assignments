Media type name: audio

Media subtype name: vnd.blockfact.facta

Required parameters:

version: Specifies the version of the .facta format (e.g., 1.0)
content-type: MIME type of the wrapped audio (e.g., audio/mpeg)
blockchain-id: Blockchain transaction ID or contract reference
checksum: Hash to verify integrity (e.g., SHA-256)
encryption-key: Identifier for the decryption key

Optional parameters:

encryption: Encryption type for metadata (e.g., AES256)
compression: Indicates if audio content is compressed (true/false)
duration: Media length (e.g., 00:03:42)
title: Title of the audio
artist: Creator of the content
description: Textual description of the content

Encoding considerations: binary

Security considerations: Checksum and blockchain reference ensure authenticity and prevent tampering.

Transport over secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS) is recommended.

Interoperability considerations: Lite systems may play the audio without verifying metadata.

Full systems can decrypt metadata and verify authenticity.

Published specification: https://blockfact.io/specifications/facta.txt

Applications which use this media: BlockFact Audio Verification Tools, blockchain-integrated media players, audio archiving systems.

Fragment identifier considerations: N/A

Restrictions on usage: .facta files should not be used in environments or protocols where metadata integrity could be lost or manipulated:

- Transmission over unsecured channels (e.g., HTTP, FTP) is discouraged.
- Legacy file systems that strip custom metadata may cause verification failure.
- Automated pipelines that alter file headers or inject new metadata may invalidate verification.
- Offline environments without blockchain access cannot validate authenticity.
