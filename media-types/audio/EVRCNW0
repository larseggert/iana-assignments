Type name: audio

Subtype names: EVRCNW0

Required parameters: None

Optional parameters:

These parameters apply to RTP transfer only.

mode-set-recv: A subset of EVRC-NW modes.  Possible values are a
comma separated list of modes from the set {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7} (see
Table 2.6.1.2-4 in 3GPP2 C.S0014-D).  A decoder can use this
attribute to inform an encoder of its preference to operate in a
specified subset of modes.  Absence of this parameter signals the
mode set {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}.

ptime: see RFC 8866.

silencesupp: see Section 6.1 in RFC 4788.

dtxmax: see Section 6.1 in RFC 4788.

dtxmin: see Section 6.1 in RFC 4788.

hangover: see Section 6.1 in RFC 4788.

Encoding considerations:

This media type is framed binary data (see RFC 6838, Section 4.8) and
is defined for transfer of EVRC-NW encoded data via RTP using the
header-free packet format specified in RFC 3558.

Security considerations: See Section 16 of [RFC6884].

Interoperability considerations: None

Published specification:

The EVRC-NW vocoder is specified in 3GPP2 C.S0014-D.  The transfer
method with the header-free packet format via RTP is specified in RFC
3558.

Applications that use this media type:

It is expected that many VoIP applications (as well as mobile
applications) will use this type.

Additional information: None

Intended usage: COMMON

Restrictions on usage:

This media type depends on RTP framing and hence is only defined
for transfer via RTP (RFC 3550).  The RTP payload format specified 
in Section 4.2 of RFC 3558 SHALL be used.  This media type SHALL 
NOT be used for storage or file transfer; instead, audio/EVRCNW
SHALL be used.
