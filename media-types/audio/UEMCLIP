(per RFC5686)

Media type name:  audio

Media subtype name:  UEMCLIP

Required parameters:

   Rate:  Defines the sampling rate, and it MUST be either 8000 or
      16000.  See Section 6.2.1 "Mode specification" of RFC 5686
      (this RFC) for details.

Optional parameters:

   ptime:  See RFC 8866.

   maxptime:  See RFC 8866.

   mode:  Indicates the range of dynamically changeable modes during
      a session.  Possible values are a comma-separated list of modes
      from the supported mode set: 0, 1, 3, and 4.  If only one mode
      is specified, it means that the mode must not be changed during
      the session.  When not specified, the mode transmission
      defaults to a singular mode as specified in Table 4.  See
      Section 6.2.1 "Mode specification" of RFC 5686 (this RFC) for
      details.

Encoding considerations:  This media type is framed and contains
   binary data.  See Section 4.8 of RFC 4288.

Security considerations:  See Section 7 "Security Considerations" of
   RFC 5686 (this RFC).

Interoperability considerations:  This media may be readily
   transcoded to u-law-encoded ITU-T G.711.  See Section 4
   "Transcoding between UEMCLIP and G.711" of RFC 5686 (this RFC).

Published specification:  RFC 5686 (this RFC)

Applications that use this media type:  Audio and video streaming and
   conferencing tools.

Additional information:  None
