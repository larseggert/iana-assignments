(RFC 3555 published July 2003, subtype last updated March 2007 per RFC4856)

Type name: audio

Subtype name: PCMA

Required parameters:
	rate: The RTP timestamp clock rate, which is equal to the
	sampling rate.  The typical rate is 8000, but other rates may
	be specified.

Optional parameters:
	channels: how many audio streams are interleaved -- defaults
	to 1; stereo would be 2, etc.  Interleaving takes place
	between individual one-byte samples.  The channel order is as
	specified in RFC 3551.

	ptime, maxptime: see RFC 4566

Encoding considerations:
	This media type is framed binary data (see Section 4.8 in RFC
	4288).

Security considerations:
	This media type does not carry active content.  It does
	transfer compressed data.  See Section 4 of RFC 4856.

Interoperability considerations: none

Published specification: RFC 3551

Applications that use this media type:
	Audio and video streaming and conferencing tools.

Additional information: none

Person & email address to contact for further information:
	Stephen Casner <casner&acm.org>

Intended usage: COMMON

Restrictions on usage:
	This media type depends on RTP framing, and hence is only
	defined for transfer via RTP (RFC 3550).  Transfer within
	other framing protocols is not defined at this time.
