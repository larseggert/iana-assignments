Specification Document(s): 
https://github.com/knightfoxapps/mtrust-uri-spec/blob/main/mtrust-uri-specification.txt 


Scheme Semantics: 
The `mtrust` URI scheme is designed for trusted communication between ModelTrust Protocol (MTP) clients and servers. It enables resource identification and command signaling within AI Model Proxy Control (MPC) environments.

General form: 
mtrust://<authority>/<resource>?<parameters>

Example: 
mtrust://controller.domain.example/task/execute?model_id=xyz123

Encoding Considerations: 
The scheme uses UTF-8 encoding for the path and query segments, with percent-encoding as specified in RFC 3986 [RFC3986].

Applications/Protocols Using This Scheme: 
ModelTrust Protocol (MTP) Clients and Servers 
AI MPC Systems for secured model control and command messaging 

Interoperability Considerations: 
Interoperability is ensured within systems implementing MTP; usage outside this scope requires compatible implementation.

Security Considerations: 
The scheme requires strict access control, authentication, and encrypted transport (TLS). Improper use may result in unauthorized access to AI control systems.

Additional Information:
