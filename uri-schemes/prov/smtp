URI scheme name: smtp

Status: provisional

URI scheme syntax:
smtpuri = "smtp://" authority ["/" [ "?" query ]]
authority = <defined in RFC 3986>
query = <defined in RFC 3986>
If :<port> is omitted from authority, the port defaults to 25.
The query component is reserved for future extensions.

URI scheme semantics:
The smtp: URI scheme is used to designate SMTP servers (e.g.
listener endpoints, S/MIME agents performing Domain signing), SMTP
accounts.
There is no MIME type associated with this URI.

Encoding considerations:
SMTP user names are UTF-8 strings and MUST be percent-encoded as
required by the URI specification [RFC3986], Section 2.1.

Applications/protocols that use this URI scheme name:
The smtp: URI is intended to be used by applications that might
need access to an SMTP server (for example email clients or MTAs)
or for SMTP servers to describe their listener endpoints.


Interoperability considerations:
Several implementations are already using smtp: URIs for server
configuration.

Security considerations: Clients resolving smtp: URIs that wish to
achieve data confidentiality and/or integrity SHOULD use the
STARTTLS command (if supported by the server) before starting
authentication, or use a SASL mechanism, such as GSSAPI, that
provides a confidentiality security layer.
