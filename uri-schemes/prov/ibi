Scheme names:
     ibi

Status: provisional

Applications/protocols that use this scheme name:

- IBI stands for "Internet-Based Identifier" or "IP-Based Identifier".
- The IBI syntax has been proposed in 1995.
- IBIs have been used since then at Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espacias (INPE),
  the Brazilian Institute for Space Research, to identify all types of documents that
  are part of the Institute's scientific and technical output.

- IBI became a Brazilian standard under:
  ABNT NBR 16066
  First edition: 2012, second edition: 2026
  Portuguese title: "Sistema para geração de identificador com base na internet (IBI)";
  English title: "Internet-Based Identifiers (IBI) generation system".
  ABNT NBR 16709
  First edition: 2018
  Portuguese title: "Sistema para resolução de identificador com base na internet (IBI)";
  English title: "Internet-Based Identifiers (IBI) resolution system".
- ABNT (Associação Brasileira de Normas Técnicas) is the Brazilian Association of
  Technical Standards, a private, non-profit organization and a founding member of
  the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

- The IBI resolver is urlib.net

- The ibi URI scheme is used to access the resource along with its descriptive top menu.
- The ibi- URI scheme is used to access only the resource.

What differentiates the IBI generation/resolution system from other sytems is (see [1]):

- The IBI are generated automatically upon demand by a simple, yet powerful program
  running on the client server [2];
- The identifier prefix assigned to the Archive is the fully qualified domain name of
  the Archive server itself (no other special centrality is required);
- The identifier suffix is the IBI identifier creation time (no associated permanent memory
  is needed);
- The identifier resolver (urlib.net) is just a cache which is updated when needed by
  querying the Archive servers.

The proposed IBI URI schemes are intended to be used in "relative hyperlinks" as
  exemplified in [3], to preserve the functionality and integrity of the hypertexts over
  the long term.

In this case, registering the IBI URI scheme is essential to ensure the uniqueness of
  the IBI URIs forever, since the domain name of the IBI resolver (urlib.net) no longer
  appears explicitly in the Relative Persistent Hyperlinks.
