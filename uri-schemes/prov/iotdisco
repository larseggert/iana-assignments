Abstract

   This document contains the formal application for registering a
   provisioninal Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) Scheme named
   iotdisco, a URI scheme to be used to identify, not locate, things on
   the internet using conceptual meta-data about the thing.

Keywords

Introduction

   When creating things to be mass-manufactured and sold off-the-shelf
   for use with the Internet of Things, and taking their entire life-
   cycle into account, a problem arises where a thing’s physical
   identity, which is known at the time of production, needs to be
   matched with its communication or network identity, created during
   installation, and the match given to its owner, and only its owner,
   to avoid malicious third parties to claim the thing for their own.
   Only the physical (or conceptual) identity of the thing is known
   during the time of manufacture, not the network identity or the
   identity of the owner.

   In the article "Securing the Life Cycle of Things in the Internet of
   Things using Thing Registries" [1], an architecture is described
   where a thing is preprogrammed with meta-data about itself, uniquely
   identifying it. Once the thing has been physically installed and 
   connected to a network, a network identity is created by the thing. 
   The thing then searches for a Thing Registry, to which it later 
   registers itself, its meta-data and newly created network identity. 
   Later, the meta-data is transferred to the owner of the thing. The 
   owner, perhaps using a smart-phone, finds the same Thing Registry 
   and claims the thing by providing the same meta-data earlier 
   registered by the thing. This claiming process provides the thing 
   with the network identity of its owner, and the owner with the 
   network identity of its thing. The thing cannot be claimed again, 
   unless it has been disowned again.

   The article also presents a physical implementation of this 
   architecture, where devices are installed in an IP network, and 
   later use the XMPP protocol [2] [3] [4] to find a Thing Registry 
   and perform the registration. The meta-data is transferred to the 
   owner using a QR-code which encodes the corresponding key-value 
   pairs, which has previously been serialized into a string. XEP-0347 
   [5] and XEP-0348 [6] provide more detailed information about the 
   network identity creation process, how the Thing Registry is found 
   and how the thing registers itself and how it is claimed in this 
   example. QR codes can be presented to owners either from a sticker 
   on the device or its box, or on its screen if it has one.

Justification for this registration application

   During the work in ISO/IEC/IEEE working group 21451-1-4, where this 
   architecture is an integral part, and other groups, a more formal 
   definition, structure and encoding of the conceptual identity of a 
   thing, or its meta-data, is required. Since there is a desire to use
   Automatic identification and data capture (AIDC) technologies, such 
   as RFID and 2-dimensional optical symbologies, for instance QR-codes,
   for transferring this information, and since such technologies are
   capable of containing URIs, the proposed manner to formalizing this
   string, is to register a new URI scheme for the conceptual identity
   of a thing. QR-codes are used in this document only as an example.
   URIs using this URI scheme can then be recognized, by smartphones
   for instance – while residing in the same network environment as the
   corresponding thing – can use the same methods of finding the thing
   registry and claiming the thing for its own, and at the same time
   obtain the network identity of the thing.

   The URI scheme proposed in this application differs slightly from
   what has been described in [1] and [5] to better match requirements
   in BCP 35 [7] and RFC 3986 [8]. Once accepted as a provisional URI
   scheme, [1] and [5] will be updated.

URI Scheme Registration

   Following is the formal application for the registration of the
   provisional URI scheme iotdisco.

URI scheme name

   iotdisco

Status

   provisional

URI scheme syntax

   Using the format defined in RFC 3986 [8], and some of its base
   classes, a formal definition of the iotdisco URI scheme syntax is as
   follows:

         iotdisco-uri = "iotdisco:" tags
         tags         = tag *( ";" tag )
         tag          = stringtag / numericaltag
         stringtag    = key "=" strvalue
         numericaltag = "#" key "=" numvalue
         key          = 1*( unreserved / pct-encoded )
         strvalue     = *( unreserved / pct-encoded )
         numvalue     = [ "+" / "-" ] 1*DIGIT [ "." *DIGIT ]

   Example:

         iotdisco:SN=394872348732948723;MAN=www.ktc.se;
            MODEL=IMC;#V=1.2;KEY=4857402340298342

   A line-break has been inserted for readability. The corresponding
   URI as a QR-code would look as follows:

URI scheme semantics

   An iotdisco URI defines a set of one or more meta-data tags. Each tag
   has a key name and either a string value or a numerical value. The
   reason for specifying numerical values separately is because they
   imply a numerical order to the value set.

   The set of tags is unordered. This means that in order to compare two
   iotdisco URIs for equality, the tags must be ordered first, using the
   same ordering.

   Tag keys are also case insensitive. Values, however, are case
   sensitive.

Encoding considerations

   Since tag keys and string values can be human readable, it is
   important to encode characters outside of the unreserved character
   set correctly. The way to do this, is to first normalize such
   characters using Unicode Normalization Form C [9], then encode them
   using UTF-8 [10], and then percent-encoding them according to §2.1
   and §2.5 in RFC 3986 [8].

Applications/protocols that use this URI scheme name

   This URI scheme does not specify underlying transport protocol, and
   is not limited to a particular protocol. A variant of this scheme is
   used together with the XMPP protocol [2] [3] [4] and XEP-0347 [5],
   which will be updated as soon as this provisional URI scheme has been
   approved.

Interoperability considerations

   It is not the intent of this document to limit the amount or types of
   tags thing manufacturers might want to encode using this URI scheme,
   or their semantic meanings. But, to provide some guidance and foster
   interoperability, on the side of thing registries, especially if
   public, XEP-0347 [5] proposed a set of predefined tags manufacturers
   can use (in §5.2). This table is duplicated here:

                      Table 2. Predefined tag keys.

    | Tag Key  | Type    | Description                               |

    | STREETNR | String  | Street Number                             |
    | V        | Numeric | Version Number                            |

Security considerations

   Collecting and storing meta-data about things may both be very
   valuable, as a tool to organize, discover and interconnect things in
   the network, but also dangerous if not considering various security
   aspects. Many of these security considerations must be dealt with on
   a protocol-by-protocol level, as is done in XEP-0347 [5], section 6.
   There, an architecture consisting of both public and private things
   is defined, and how to manage meta-data in searches, including meta-
   data that is constantly being updated by things. It also specifies
   that only claimed things, whose owners have approved of their meta-
   data being published, should have their meta-data being searchable.

   While the meta-data being encoded using this URI scheme is used by
   the owner of a thing to claim it, the meta-data must pass a Thing
   Registry in order to match conceptual identity with network identity.
   In doing so, the Thing Registry is free to store the meta-data. Care
   should therefore be made in publishing meta-data of a sensitive
   nature.

   There is also a special tag named KEY. This provides a means to
   include private random information into the meta-data that can be
   used to make sure the meta-data is unique. Thing Registries must be
   aware of the meaning of this key, and not publish it or make it
   searchable. While a thing can only be claimed by one owner at a time,
   Thing Registries should erase the KEY tag from its internal records
   once a thing has been claimed. This avoids the possibility of others
   to learn the value of the KEY tag, and claim the corresponding thing
   using searchable meta-data or extracting the information by other
   means, once the thing has become disowned. The thing in turn must
   report a new KEY tag if being disowned, to make sure it can be re-
   claimed.
