Scheme name: thzp

Status: Provisional

Applications/protocols that use this scheme name: Terahertz Game Framework

Contact: admin&spearhead.industries

Change controller: admin&spearhead.industries

References:
The IP address of a host may not be available to the framework depending on
the implementation. As such, an alternative identifier is required so the
framework can identify users by either an IP address, or a unique User ID,
depending on the availability of the address.

The "thzp" scheme is specified as follows:

Scheme syntax: thzp://<address|[userid] "@" [serverid]>

Scheme semantics: URIs in the "thzp" scheme are to be used for identifying
connected hosts in a multiplayer video game framework.

Encoding considerations: ASCII characters only.

Interoperability considerations: None.

Security considerations: None.
