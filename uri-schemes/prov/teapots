Scheme name: teapots

Status: Provisional

Applications/protocols that use this scheme name:
The teapot and teapots schemes are intended as a conceptual extension or experimental variant of HTTP and HTTPS. They are aimed at exploring enhanced negotiation mechanisms, stricter security requirements, and specialized operational features. In future versions, they may serve as a framework for advanced web services requiring more flexible resource interactions and potential custom semantics beyond what current HTTP provides.
