URI scheme name: at

Status: provisional

URI scheme syntax:
    at://<authority>
    at://<authority>/<collection>
    at://<authority>/<collection>/<record-key>

    "authority" may be a "handle" (hostname) or a W3C DID

Examples:
    at://user.example.com
    at://did:plc:24ybard66vv44zksje25o7dz
    at://did:plc:24ybard66vv44zksje25o7dz/app.bsky.feed.post/3jwdwj2ctlk25

URI scheme semantics:
    Reference a repository, collection, or record in the Authenticated
Transfer Protocol (AT Protocol)
    The "authority" part references an account identity, which is not
necessarily the network host where the indicated resource can be found.

Encoding considerations:
    All current supported use-cases of AT-URI can be met with the ASCII
subset of UTF-8 (Unicode)

Applications/protocols that use this URI scheme name:
    The Bluesky social network (https://bsky.app), running on top of AT
Protocol

Interoperability considerations:
    The use of DID of the "authority" section, with multiple un-encoded
colon characters (":"), precludes direct compatibility with the WHATWG URL
standard.

Security considerations:                                                                                          
    Unknown, use with care
