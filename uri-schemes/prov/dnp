Scheme Name: dnp

Status: Provisional

Description: dnp

Applications/protocols that use this scheme name:

The DNP client (Desktop Native Protocol Client) uses the DNP solution. It is a cross-platform desktop application that enables secure interaction between web applications and locally installed software.
It supports unified identity login, credential import, and secure token exchange between web and desktop environments.

The current desktop client's Chinese name which using DNP is called the Lightweight Access Connector and can be downloaded from this URL (https://www.teleinfo.cn/dnp/web/#/index). We are also considering making the application available directly to merchants. In addition, other vendors will develop DNP-based desktop applications in the future, and the specific schema will continue to be refined.

Additional Info:

The DNP URI scheme is a necessary solution for protecting the security of user private keys, which securely calls locally installed DNP clients from web pages and desktop applications through DNP.
Complete a unified identity authentication login, registration, and credential import process through DNP, enabling web applications to communicate with trusted local applications in a standard and secure manner.
Retaining this scheme name ensures interoperability and security of these identity and credential operations.

Reference implementation: https://www.npmjs.com/package/dnp-client

Example usage:
- dnp://login?type=1&callbackUrl=https://example.com/afterLogin
- dnp://register?subject={userPayload}
- dnp://importCert?crt=PEM_STRING&certType=pfx

This scheme is intended strictly for local invocation and identity workflows, not for general network transport.
