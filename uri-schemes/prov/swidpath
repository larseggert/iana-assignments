Note: 

This scheme has been documented by an IETF working group, and is mentioned in an IETF standard specification. But as it describes a locally scoped, limited purpose, form of identification, it does not fully meet the requirements for permanent registration.

As long as the specification (RFC-ietf-sacm-coswid-24, or successors) that describes this scheme is a current IETF specification, this scheme should be considered to be "in use" and not considered for removal from the registry.
