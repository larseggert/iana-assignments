Resource Identifier (RI) Scheme name: shelter

Status: provisional

Scheme syntax:
shelter: [ "//" authority "/" ] cid [ "?" query ]

Scheme semantics:
A resource or subresource of the Shelter Protocol

Encoding considerations:
Any reserved characters, as defined in [STD66], MUST be encoded when used in
a 'shelter' URI.

Applications/protocols that use this scheme name:
HTTP(S) as a transport protocol is assumed.

Security considerations:
General security consideration for URIs are as discussed in [STD66].

A Shelter resource can refer to computer code that could result in dynamic
code execution, such as smart contracts, or additional network requests,
such as interacting with a smart contract. In these cases, implementers
SHOULD take care to ensure that dynamically executed code has a
trusted provenance and is properly sandboxed, and that any interactions with
resources follow clear rules understood by users.

The specific semantics and content type of a resource is context-dependent,
which can be addressed by embedding content type information within a CID.
Implementers MAY enforce semantics and content type information though
this mechanism.
