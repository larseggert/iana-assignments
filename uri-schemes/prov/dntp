URI Scheme syntax:
The ABNF [RFC5234] rule for parsing a DNTP-URI is as follows:

dntp-uri = "dntp://" host ":" port [ "/" key ]
key = *pct-encoded

where <host> is defined in Section 3.2.2., <port> is defined in
Section 3.2.3. and <pct-encoded> is defined in Section 2.1. of
Uniform Resource Identifier: Generic Syntax [RFC3986].

Scheme semantics:
Open a TCP connection to the specified host and port and write the
decoded octets of <key> to the stream, if any. The host may drop the
connection for whatever reason if the key is wrong, with or without
sending the reason in any format. There is no further required format
for this URI scheme and application-specific data may be sent and
received in an application-specific format and/or encoding after the
initial set-up. Typically, the URI is distributed via a secure mechanism
and keys of up to 4096 encoded octets are to be expected.
If the URI is invoked by an application, the default operation is to
read from the stream without writing any more octets other than the
key.

Encoding considerations:
None.

Applications/protocols that use this scheme name:
Unknown.

Interoperability considerations:
Unknown but unlikely portable due to its application-specific nature.

Security considerations:
Since the URI syntax description [RFC3986] has no a priori limitation
on the length of a URI, the DNTP-URI can possibly be used to forge
requests of other TCP protocols, e.g.


dntp://example.com:80/%47%45%54%20%2f%69%6e%64%65%78%2e%68%74%6d%6c%20%48%54%54%50%2f%31%2e%31%0d%0a%48%6f%73%74%3a%20%65%78%61%6d%70%6c%65%2e%63%6f%6d%0d%0a

will make an HTTP GET request to example.com . Use with care
and do not trust a DNTP-URI from an untrusted source.
