Scheme name:
     upn

Status: provisional

Applications/protocols that use this scheme name:

- UPN stands for "Uniform Package Name".
- The acronym UPN was chosen in reference to the Archival Information Package (AIP)
  defined in [1].
- The UPN scheme began testing in 2023 on the URLib Platform [2].
- UPNs are only in experimental use, awaiting registration before they can be released. 
     
UPN syntax is the same as URN syntax. What significantly differentiates UPN from URN is
  the process of creating/registering the namespace IDs [3].

The proposed UPN URI scheme is intended to be used in "relative hyperlinks", such as
  the IBI URI [4], but without the need for a global identifier as exemplified in [3].

In this case, registering the UPN URI scheme is essential to ensure the uniqueness of
  the UPN URIs forever, since the domain name of each possible resolvers no longer
  appears explicitly in the Relative Persistent Hyperlinks.
