Designated expert note: 

This scheme has been documented by an IETF working group, and is 
mentioned in an IETF standard specification. But as it describes a 
locally scoped, limited purpose, form of identification, it does not 
fully meet the requirements for permanent registration.

As long as the specification (RFC-ietf-sacm-coswid-24, or successors) 
that describes this scheme is a current IETF specification, this 
scheme should be considered to be "in use" and not considered for 
removal from the registry.
