Designated expert note:

This scheme has been provisionally registered under the "First Come First Served" policy set out in [RFC7595]. This means that the scheme has not been formally reviewed in the IETF, and is not recommended by the IETF for general use on the open Internet.

Further, the "w3" scheme is defined to be an abbreviation of the "web3" scheme, and URI aliases are, in general, considered harmful to the World Wide Web [R1].

(This note is intended to draw attention to potential problems that might arise if this scheme were to be used widely on the open Internet, and does not itself constitute a formal position by the IETF or IANA.)
