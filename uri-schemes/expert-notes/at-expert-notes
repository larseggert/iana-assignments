Designated expert note:

The 'at' URI scheme has been provisionally registered under the “first come first
served” policy set out in RFC 7595.  This means that the scheme has not been
formally reviewed in the IETF, and is not recommended by the IETF for general
use on the open Internet.

There has been some discussion of this scheme on the IETF URI-review list
[R1,R2], and there is a considerable degree of concern that the scheme name 'at'
could be a cause of confusion, or conflict with other common uses of the term
'at'.  For these reasons, it has been suggested that the name 'atproto' or 'atp'
might be more suitable.  This could turn out to be an impediment to a subsequent
request for permanent registration of this scheme name.

This note is intended to draw attention to potential problems that might arise
if this scheme were to be used widely on the open Internet, and does not of
itself constitute a position by the IETF or IANA on the considerations raised.
