Designated expert note:

This scheme has been provisionally registered under the "First Come 
First Served" policy set out in [RFC7595]. This means that the scheme 
has not been formally reviewed in the IETF, and is not recommended by 
the IETF for general use on the open Internet.

Further, the "dhttp" scheme is considered harmful by some in the IETF 
[R1] for at least the following reasons:

1. it creates confusion by associating with the existing "http" and 
"https" schemes of HTTP, even though the described protocol does not 
use HTTP. This could be an issue for applications that use the prefix 
"http://" and "https://" to identify links within text without 
parsing the surrounding context.

2. "dhttp" is defined to be an alias of the provisionally registered 
"web3" scheme, and URI aliases are, in general, considered harmful to 
the World Wide Web [R2].

3. Using the name "dhttp" appears to be an attempt to legitimise web3 
[R3] by association with HTTP (the current World Wide Web's primary 
interaction protocol).

This note is intended to draw attention to potential problems that 
might arise if this scheme were to be used widely on the open 
Internet, and does not itself constitute a position by the IETF or 
IANA on the considerations raised.
