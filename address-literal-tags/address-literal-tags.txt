   Note

 Sometimes a host is not known to the domain name system and
 communication (and, in particular, communication to report and repair
 the error) is blocked.  To bypass this barrier a special literal form
 of the address is allowed as an alternative to a domain name.  For
 IPv4 addresses, this form uses four small decimal integers separated
 by dots and enclosed by brackets such as [123.255.37.2], which
 indicates an (IPv4) Internet Address in sequence-of-octets form.  For
 IPv6 and other forms of addressing that might eventually be
 standardized, the form consists of a standardized "tag" that
 identifies the address syntax, a colon, and the address itself, in a
 format specified as part of the IPv6 standards [17].
