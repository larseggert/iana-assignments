     0    mechoff     An off state where no Energy Object features are available. The Energy Object is unavailable. No energy is being    [RFC7326]
                      consumed, and the power connector can be removed.
                      Similar to mechoff(0), but some components remain powered or receive trace power so that the Energy Object can be
     1    softoff     awakened from its off state. In softoff(1), no context is saved, and the device typically requires a complete boot  [RFC7326]
                      when awakened.
                      No Energy Object features are available. The Energy Object may be awakened without requiring a complete boot, but
     2    hibernate   the time for availability is longer than sleep(3). An example for state hibernate(2) is a save-to-disk state where  [RFC7326]
                      DRAM context is not maintained. Typically, energy consumption is zero or close to zero.
                      No Energy Object features are available, except for out-of-band management, such as wake-up mechanisms. The time
     3    sleep       for availability is longer than standby(4). An example for state sleep(3) is a save-to-RAM state, where DRAM        [RFC7326]
                      context is maintained. Typically, energy consumption is close to zero.
                      No Energy Object features are available, except for out-of-band management, such as wake-up mechanisms. This mode
     4    standby     is analogous to cold-standby. The time for availability is longer than ready(5). For example, processor context may [RFC7326]
                      not be maintained. Typically, energy consumption is close to zero.
                      No Energy Object features are available, except for out-of-band management, such as wake-up mechanisms. This mode
     5    ready       is analogous to hot-standby. The Energy Object can be quickly transitioned into an operational state. For example,  [RFC7326]
                      processors are not executing, but processor context is maintained.
     6    lowMinus    Indicates that some Energy Object features may not be available and the Energy Object has taken measures or         [RFC7326]
                      selected options to use less energy than low(7).
     7    low         Indicates that some Energy Object features may not be available and the Energy Object has taken measures or         [RFC7326]
                      selected options to use less energy than mediumMinus(8).
     8    mediumMinus Indicates that all Energy Object features are available but the Energy Object has taken measures or selected        [RFC7326]
                      options to use less energy than medium(9).
     9    medium      Indicates that all Energy Object features are available but the Energy Object has taken measures or selected        [RFC7326]
                      options to use less energy than highMinus(10).
     10   highMinus   Indicates that all Energy Object features are available and the Energy Object has taken measures or selected        [RFC7326]
                      options to use less energy than high(11).
     11   high        Indicates that all Energy Object features are available and the Energy Object may use the maximum energy as         [RFC7326]
                      indicated by the Nameplate Power.
