   Description

 The MIB module registers object identifier values for
 well-known programming and scripting languages. Every
 language registration MUST describe the format used
 when transferring scripts written in this language.

 Any additions or changes to the contents of this MIB
 module require Designated Expert Review as defined in
 the Guidelines for Writing IANA Considerations Section
 document. The Designated Expert will be selected by
 the IESG Area Director of the OPS Area.

 Note, this module does not have to register all possible
 languages since languages are identified by object
 identifier values. It is therefore possible to registered
 languages in private OID trees. The references given below are not
 normative with regard to the language version. Other
 references might be better suited to describe some newer
 versions of this language. The references are only
 provided as `a pointer into the right direction'.
