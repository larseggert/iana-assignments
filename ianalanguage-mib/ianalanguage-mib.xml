  <description>The MIB module registers object identifier values for
well-known programming and scripting languages. Every
language registration MUST describe the format used
when transferring scripts written in this language.

Any additions or changes to the contents of this MIB
module require Designated Expert Review as defined in
the Guidelines for Writing IANA Considerations Section
document. The Designated Expert will be selected by
the IESG Area Director of the OPS Area.

Note, this module does not have to register all possible
languages since languages are identified by object
identifier values. It is therefore possible to registered
languages in private OID trees. The references given below are not
normative with regard to the language version. Other
references might be better suited to describe some newer
versions of this language. The references are only
provided as `a pointer into the right direction'.</description>
