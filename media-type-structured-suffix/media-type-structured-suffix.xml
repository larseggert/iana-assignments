      Registrations which use this
      '+xml' convention MUST also make reference to <xref type="rfc" data="rfc7303"/>,
      specifically Section 5, in specifying fragment identifier syntax
      and semantics, and they MAY restrict the syntax to a specified
      subset of schemes, except that they MUST NOT disallow barenames or
      'element' scheme pointers.  They MAY further require support for
      other registered schemes.  They also MAY add additional syntax
      (which MUST NOT overlap with <xref type="uri" data="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-xptr-framework-20030325/">XPointerFramework</xref> syntax) together

        Each individual media type registered with a +sqlite3 suffix can have
        additional security considerations. For example, if a specific
        registration requires that certain extension functions are available,
        or that blob fields contain data to be processed by other libraries or
        external tools, or if only a single implementation exists to handle
        a specific registered media type, then this increases the known attack
        surface available to an attacker.

          GZIP format doesn't provide confidentiality

          Additionally, GZIP objects can contain multiple files and associated
          paths.  File paths must be validated when the files are extracted; a
          malicious file path could otherwise cause the extractor to overwrite
          application or system files.
