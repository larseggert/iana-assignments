   Registration Procedure(s)

 Specification Required

   Expert(s)

 Yoav Nir, Rich Salz, Nick Sullivan

   Reference
   [RFC8446][RFC8447][RFC9146]

   Note

 Registration requests should be sent to the mailing list described
 in [RFC 8447, Section 17]. If approved, designated experts should
 notify IANA within three weeks. For assistance, please contact
 iana@iana.org.


   Note

 The role of the designated expert is described in [RFC8447].
 The designated expert [RFC8126] ensures that the specification is
 publicly available.  It is sufficient to have an Internet-Draft
 (that is posted and never published as an RFC) or a document from
 another standards body, industry consortium, university site, etc.
 The expert may provide more in-depth reviews, but their approval
 should not be taken as an endorsement of the extension.


   Note

 As specified in [RFC8126], assignments made in the Private Use
 space are not generally useful for broad interoperability.  It is
 the responsibility of those making use of the Private Use range to
 ensure that no conflicts occur (within the intended scope of use).
 For widespread experiments, temporary reservations are available.


   Note

 If an item is not marked as "Recommended", it does not
 necessarily mean that it is flawed; rather, it indicates that the
 item either has not been through the IETF consensus process, has
 limited applicability, or is intended only for specific use cases.


   Note

 The addition of the "CR" to the "TLS 1.3" column for the
 server_name(0) extension only marks the extension as valid in a
 ClientCertificateRequest created as part of client-generated
 authenticator requests.

   Expert(s)

 Yoav Nir, Rich Salz, Nick Sullivan

   Reference
   [RFC6091][RFC8446][RFC8447]

   Note

 Registration requests should be sent to the mailing list described
 in [RFC 8447, Section 17]. If approved, designated experts should
 notify IANA within three weeks. For assistance, please contact
 iana@iana.org.


   Note

 The role of the designated expert is described in [RFC8447].
 The designated expert [RFC8126] ensures that the specification is
 publicly available.  It is sufficient to have an Internet-Draft
 (that is posted and never published as an RFC) or a document from
 another standards body, industry consortium, university site, etc.
 The expert may provide more in-depth reviews, but their approval
 should not be taken as an endorsement of the certificate type.


   Note

 If an item is not marked as "Recommended", it does not
 necessarily mean that it is flawed; rather, it indicates that
 the item either has not been through the IETF consensus process,
 has limited applicability, or is intended only for specific use
 cases.
