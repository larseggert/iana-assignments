SMTP Service Extensions

   Registration Procedure(s)

 Either Model 1 (IETF) or Model 2 (FCFS) as described in Sections 8.1.1.1 of [RFC-ietf-emailcore-rfc5321bis-43].

   Reference
   [RFC-ietf-emailcore-rfc5321bis-43, Sections 8.1.1, 2.2.2]

   Note

 The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol [RFC-ietf-emailcore-rfc5321bis-43]
 specifies a set of commands or services and a general procedure for
 extending that set. The table below lists SMTP service extensions.
 Both message submission [RFC6409]and mail transfer
 [RFC-ietf-emailcore-rfc5321bis-43] may use these extensions unless
 otherwise specified.


   Note

 The SMTP Extension names/keywords registered in this section are for
 general use. For those specific to Multicast email, see the registry
 for that protocol below.

Mail Transmission Types for the "Received:" Header Field

   Reference
   [RFC-ietf-emailcore-rfc5321bis-43, Sections 8.1.3, 8.1.4][RFC-ietf-emailcore-rfc5322bis-12]

   Note

 The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol [RFC-ietf-emailcore-rfc5321bis-43]
 and the Standard for Internet Message Formats [RFC-ietf-emailcore-rfc5322bis-12]
 specify that a set of "Received" lines will be prepended to the
 headers of electronic mail messages as they are transported through
 the Internet. These received line may optionally include either or
 both a "via" phrase and/or a "with" phrase.  The legal values for the
 phrases are listed here. The via phrase is intended to indicate the
 link or physical medium over which the message was transferred.  The
 with phrase is intended to indicate the protocol or logical process
 that was used to transfer the message.

Address Literal Tags

   Registration Procedure(s)

 Standards Action

   Reference
   [RFC-ietf-emailcore-rfc5321bis-43]

   Note

 Sometimes a host is not known to the domain name system and
 communication (and, in particular, communication to report and repair
 the error) is blocked.  To bypass this barrier a special literal form
 of the address is allowed as an alternative to a domain name.  For
 IPv4 addresses, this form uses four small decimal integers separated
 by dots and enclosed by brackets such as [123.255.37.2], which
 indicates an (IPv4) Internet Address in sequence-of-octets form.  For
 IPv6 and other forms of addressing that might eventually be
 standardized, the form consists of a standardized "tag" that
 identifies the address syntax, a colon, and the address itself, in a
 format specified as part of the IPv6 standards [RFC5952].

   [RFC9788]

   Note

 Adding an entry to this registry with an N in the "Recommended"
 column follows the registration policy of Specification Required.
 Adding an entry to this registry with a Y in the "Recommended"
 column or changing the "Recommended" column in an existing entry
 (from N to Y or vice versa) requires IETF Review.


   Note

 The Header Confidentiality Policy Name never appears on the wire.
 This registry merely tracks stable references to implementable
 descriptions of distinct policies. Any addition to this registry
 should be governed by guidance in Section 3.4.2 of
 [RFC9788].
