Header Fields

   Reference
           [RFC3261][RFC3427][RFC5727]

   Note

 The table below lists the header fields currently defined for the
 Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261]. Some headers have
 single-letter compact forms (Section 7.3 of RFC 3261). Header field
 names are case-insensitive.

 Standard header fields and messages MUST NOT begin with the leading
 characters "P-".  Existing "P-" header field registrations are
 considered grandfathered, but new registrations of Informational
 header fields should not begin with the leading characters "P-"
 (unless the "P-" would preserve compatibility with an pre-existing
 unregistered usage of the header field, at the discretion of the
 Designated Expert).  Short forms of header fields MUST only be
 assigned to standards track header fields. At the discretion of the
 Designated Expert, a header registration may require a Standards
 Action.

           [RFC3261][RFC5727]

   Note

 Option tags are used in header fields such as Require,
 Supported, Proxy-Require, and Unsupported in support of SIP
 compatibility mechanisms for extensions. The option tag
 itself is a string that is associated with a particular SIP
 option (that is, an extension). It identifies the option to
 SIP endpoints.

             Name                                                            Description                                                  Reference
                            This option tag is for reliability of provisional responses. When present in a Supported header, it indicates
   100rel                   that the UA can send or receive reliable provisional responses. When present in a Require header in a request [RFC3262]
                            it indicates that the UAS MUST send all provisional responses reliably. When present in a Require header in a
                            reliable provisional response, it indicates that the response is to be sent reliably.
                            This option-tag is for indicating support of the 199 Early Dialog Terminated provisional response code. When
   199                      present in a Supported header of a request, it indicates that the UAC supports the 199 response code. When    [RFC6228]
                            present in a Require or Proxy-Require header field of a request, it indicates that the UAS, or proxies, MUST
                            support the 199 response code. It does not require the UAS, or proxies, to actually send 199 responses.
   answermode               This option tag is for support of the Answer-Mode and Priv-Answer-Mode extensions used to negotiate automatic [RFC5373]
                            or manual answering of a request.
   early-session            A UA adding the early-session option tag to a message indicates that it understands the early-session content [RFC3959]
                            disposition.
   eventlist                Extension to allow subscriptions to lists of resources                                                        [RFC4662]
   explicitsub              This option tag identifies an extension to REFER to suppress the implicit subscription and provide a URI for  [RFC7614]
                            an explicit subscription.
   from-change              This option tag is used to indicate that a UA supports changes to URIs in From and To header fields during a  [RFC4916]
                            dialog.
                            The "geolocation-http" option tag signals support for acquiring location information via an HTTP [RFC2616]. A
   geolocation-http         location recipient who supports this option can request location with an HTTP GET and parse a resulting 200   [RFC6442]
                            response containing a PIDF-LO object. The URI schemes supported by this option include "http" and "https".
                            The "geolocation-sip" option tag signals support for acquiring location information via the presence event
   geolocation-sip          package of SIP [RFC3856]. A location recipient who supports this option can send a SUBSCRIBE request and      [RFC6442]
                            parse a resulting NOTIFY containing a PIDF-LO object. The URI schemes supported by this option include "sip",
                            "sips", and "pres".
                            This option tag is used to identify the extension that provides Registration for Multiple Phone Numbers in
   gin                      SIP. When present in a Require or Proxy-Require header field of a REGISTER request, it indicates that support [RFC6140]
                            for this extension is required of registrars and proxies, respectively, that are a party to the registration
                            transaction.
                            This option tag is used to identify the Globally Routable User Agent URI (GRUU) extension. When used in a
   gruu                     Supported header, it indicates that a User Agent understands the extension. When used in a Require header     [RFC5627]
                            field of a REGISTER request, it indicates that the registrar is not expected to process the registration
                            unless it supports the GRUU extension.
                            When used with the Supported header field, this option tag indicates the UAC supports the History Information
   histinfo                 to be captured for requests and returned in subsequent responses. This tag is not used in a Proxy-Require or  [RFC7044]
                            Require header field, since support of History-Info is optional.
   ice                      This option tag is used to identify the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) extension. When present  [RFC5768]
                            in a Require header field, it indicates that ICE is required by an agent.
   join                     Support for the SIP Join Header                                                                               [RFC3911]
   multiple-refer           This option tag indicates support for REFER requests that contain a resource list document describing         [RFC5368]
                            multiple REFER targets.
   norefersub               This option tag specifies a User Agent ability of accepting a REFER request without establishing an implicit  [RFC4488]
                            subscription (compared to the default case defined in [RFC3515].
   nosub                    This option tag identifies an extension to REFER to suppress the implicit subscription and indicate that no   [RFC7614]
                            explicit subscription is forthcoming.
                            This option-tag is used to identify UAs and Registrars which support extensions for Client Initiated
   outbound                 Connections. A UA places this option in a Supported header to communicate its support for this extension. A   [RFC5626]
                            Registrar places this option-tag in a Require header to indicate to the registering User Agent that the
                            Registrar used registrations using the binding rules defined in this extension.
                            A SIP UA that supports the Path extension header field includes this option tag as a header field value in a
                            Supported header field in all requests generated by that UA. Intermediate proxies may use the presence of
   path                     this option tag in a REGISTER request to determine whether to offer Path service for for that request. If an  [RFC3327]
                            intermediate proxy requires that the registrar support Path for a request, then it includes this option tag
                            as a header field value in a Requires header field in that request.
   policy                   This option tag is used to indicate that a UA can process policy server URIs for and subscribe to             [RFC6794]
                            session-specific policies.
                            An offerer MUST include this tag in the Require header field if the offer contains one or more "mandatory"
   precondition             strength-tags. If all the strength-tags in the description are "optional" or "none" the offerer MUST include  [RFC3312]
                            this tag either in a Supported header field or in a Require header field.
   pref                     This option tag is used to ensure that a server understands the callee capabilities parameters used in the    [RFC3840]
                            request.
                            This option tag indicates support for the Privacy mechanism. When used in the Proxy-Require header, it
   privacy                  indicates that proxy servers do not forward the request unless they can provide the requested privacy         [RFC3323]
                            service. This tag is not used in the Require or Supported headers. Proxies remove this option tag before
                            forwarding the request if the desired privacy function has been performed.
   recipient-list-invite    The body contains a list of URIs that indicates the recipients of the SIP INVITE request                      [RFC5366]
   recipient-list-message   The body contains a list of URIs that indicates the recipients of the SIP MESSAGE request                     [RFC5365]
   recipient-list-subscribe This option tag is used to ensure that a server can process the recipient-list body used in a SUBSCRIBE       [RFC5367]
                            request.
                            This option tag is to indicate the ability of the UA to receive recording indicators in media-level or
   record-aware             session-level SDP. When present in a Supported header, it indicates that the UA can receive recording         [RFC7866]
                            indicators in media-level or session-level SDP.
   replaces                 This option tag indicates support for the SIP Replaces header.                                                [RFC3891]
   resource-priority        Indicates or requests support for the resource priority mechanism.                                            [RFC4412]
                            The option-tag sdp-anat is defined for use in the Require and Supported SIP [RFC3261] header fields. SIP user
   sdp-anat                 agents that place this option-tag in a Supported header field understand the ANAT semantics as defined in     [RFC4092]
                            [RFC4091].
                            This option tag indicates support for the Security Agreement mechanism. When used in the Require, or
                            Proxy-Require headers, it indicates that proxy servers are required to use the Security Agreement mechanism.
   sec-agree                When used in the Supported header, it indicates that the User Agent Client supports the Security Agreement    [RFC3329]
                            mechanism. When used in the Require header in the 494 (Security Agreement Required) or 421 (Extension
                            Required) responses, it indicates that the User Agent Client must use the Security Agreement Mechanism.
                            This option tag is for identifying that the SIP session is for the purpose of an RS. This is typically not
   siprec                   used in a Supported header. When present in a Require header in a request, it indicates that the UA is either [RFC7866]
                            an SRC or SRS capable of handling a recording session.
                            This option tag is used to identify the target dialog header field extension. When used in a Require header
   tdialog                  field, it implies that the recipient needs to support the Target-Dialog header field. When used in a          [RFC4538]
                            Supported header field, it implies that the sender of the message supports it.
                            This option tag is for support of the session timer extension. Inclusion in a Supported header field in a
                            request or response indicates that the UA is capable of performing refreshes according to that specification.
   timer                    Inclusion in a Require header in a request means that the UAS must understand the session timer extension to  [RFC4028]
                            process the request. Inclusion in a Require header field in a response indicates that the UAC must look for
                            the Session-Expires header field in the response, and process accordingly.
   trickle-ice              This option tag is used to indicate that a UA supports and understands Trickle ICE.                           [RFC8840]
   uui                      This option tag is used to indicate that a UA supports and understands the User-to-User header field.         [RFC7433]

                  The URN identifying the User Agent, constructed as specified in section 4.1 of [RFC5626] "Managing Client-Initiated
                  Connections in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)". Since the procedure defined by [RFC5626] allows any UA to
   sfua-id        construct a value for this parameter, the sfua-id parameter MUST always be included. If the UA implements [RFC5626],    [RFC6011]
                  and includes the '+sip.instance' Contact header field parameter in any request, when requesting configuration it MUST
                  use the same value for the sfua-id parameter.
                  An identifier for a user associated with the configuration. Note that this might be different than any SIP 'user' in
   sfua-user      the UA configuration: it could, for example, be the login name of an account on the service provider web site. The      [RFC6011]
                  syntax of this parameter is that of the [RFC2617] 'userid'. See Section 2.4.1, "Configuration Data Request
                  Authentication" for how this parameter relates to authentication of the configuration data request.
   sfua-vendor    An identifier that specifies the vendor of the User Agent. The syntax of the value of this parameter is that of a DNS   [RFC6011]
                  domain. The domain value MUST be that of a domain owned by the vendor.
   sfua-model     An identifier that further specifies the User Agent from among those produced by the vendor. The syntax of the value of
                  this parameter is the same as the [RFC3261] 'token'. Values for this parameter are selected by the vendor.
   sfua-revision  An identifier that further specifies the User Agent from among those produced by the vendor. The syntax of the value of [RFC6011]
                  this parameter is the same as the [RFC3261] 'token'. Values for this parameter are selected by the vendor.

   sip.607     This feature-capability indicator, when included in a Feature-Caps header field of a REGISTER response, indicates that the [RFC8197]
               server supports, and will process, the 607 (Unwanted) response code.
               This feature-capability indicator, when inserted in a Feature-Caps header field of a SIP REGISTER request or a SIP 2xx
   sip.pns     response to a REGISTER request, denotes that the entity associated with the indicator supports the SIP push mechanism and  [RFC8599]
               the type of push notification service conveyed by the indicator value.
               This feature-capability indicator, when inserted in a SIP 2xx response to a SIP REGISTER request, denotes that the entity
   sip.vapid   associated with the indicator supports the Voluntary Application Server Identification (VAPID) mechanism when the entity   [RFC8599]
               requests that a push notification be sent to a SIP UA. The indicator value is a public key identifying the entity, which
               can be used by a SIP UA to restrict subscriptions to that entity.
               This feature-capability indicator, when inserted in a SIP 2xx response to a SIP REGISTER request, denotes that the entity
               associated with the indicator expects to receive binding-refresh REGISTER requests for the binding from the SIP UA
   sip.pnsreg  associated with the binding before the binding expires, even if the entity does not request that a push notification be    [RFC8599]
               sent to the SIP UA in order to trigger the binding-refresh REGISTER requests. The indicator value conveys the minimum time
               (given in seconds) prior to the binding expiration when the UA MUST send the REGISTER request.
               This feature-capability indicator, when inserted in a SIP 2xx response to a SIP REGISTER request, conveys that the entity
   sip.pnspurr associated with the indicator will store information that can be used to associate a mid-dialog SIP request with the       [RFC8599]
               binding information in the REGISTER request. The indicator value is an identifier that can be used as a key to retrieve
               the binding information.
               This feature-capability indicator, when included in a Feature-Caps header field of an INVITE request, indicates that the
   sip.608     entity associated with the indicator will be responsible for indicating to the caller any information contained in the 608 [RFC8688]
               SIP response code, specifically, the value referenced by the Call-Info header.
