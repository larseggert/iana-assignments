Header Fields

   Expert(s)

 Adam Roach

   Reference
           [RFC3261][RFC3427][RFC5727]

   Note

 The table below lists the header fields currently defined for the
 Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261]. Some headers have
 single-letter compact forms (Section 7.3 of RFC 3261). Header field
 names are case-insensitive.

 Standard header fields and messages MUST NOT begin with the leading
 characters "P-".  Existing "P-" header field registrations are
 considered grandfathered, but new registrations of Informational
 header fields should not begin with the leading characters "P-"
 (unless the "P-" would preserve compatibility with an pre-existing
 unregistered usage of the header field, at the discretion of the
 Designated Expert).  Short forms of header fields MUST only be
 assigned to standards track header fields. At the discretion of the
 Designated Expert, a header registration may require a Standards
 Action.

           [RFC3261][RFC5727]

   Note

 Option tags are used in header fields such as Require,
   Supported, Proxy-Require, and Unsupported in support of
   SIP compatibility mechanisms for extensions. The option
   tag itself is a string that is associated with a particular
   SIP option (that is, an extension).
   It identifies the option to SIP endpoints.

                            This option tag is for reliability of provisional responses. When present in a Supported header, it indicates
   100rel                   that the UA can send or receive reliable provisional responses. When present in a Require header in a request [RFC3262]
                            it indicates that the UAS MUST send all provisional responses reliably. When present in a Require header in a
                            reliable provisional response, it indicates that the response is to be sent reliably.
                            This option-tag is for indicating support of the 199 Early Dialog Terminated provisional response code. When
   199                      present in a Supported header of a request, it indicates that the UAC supports the 199 response code. When    [RFC6228]
                            present in a Require or Proxy-Require header field of a request, it indicates that the UAS, or proxies, MUST
                            support the 199 response code. It does not require the UAS, or proxies, to actually send 199 responses.
   answermode               This option tag is for support of the Answer-Mode and Priv-Answer-Mode extensions used to negotiate automatic [RFC5373]
                            or manual answering of a request.
   early-session            A UA adding the early-session option tag to a message indicates that it understands the early-session content [RFC3959]

   explicitsub              This option tag identifies an extension to REFER to suppress the implicit subscription and provide a URI for  [RFC7614]
                            an explicit subscription.
   from-change              This option tag is used to indicate that a UA supports changes to URIs in From and To header fields during a  [RFC4916]
                            dialog.
                            The "geolocation-http" option tag signals support for acquiring location information via an HTTP [RFC2616]. A
   geolocation-http         location recipient who supports this option can request location with an HTTP GET and parse a resulting 200   [RFC6442]
                            response containing a PIDF-LO object. The URI schemes supported by this option include "http" and "https".
                            The "geolocation-sip" option tag signals support for acquiring location information via the presence event
   geolocation-sip          package of SIP [RFC3856]. A location recipient who supports this option can send a SUBSCRIBE request and      [RFC6442]
                            parse a resulting NOTIFY containing a PIDF-LO object. The URI schemes supported by this option include "sip",
                            "sips", and "pres".
                            This option tag is used to identify the extension that provides Registration for Multiple Phone Numbers in
   gin                      SIP. When present in a Require or Proxy-Require header field of a REGISTER request, it indicates that support [RFC6140]
                            for this extension is required of registrars and proxies, respectively, that are a party to the registration
                            transaction.
                            This option tag is used to identify the Globally Routable User Agent URI (GRUU) extension. When used in a
   gruu                     Supported header, it indicates that a User Agent understands the extension. When used in a Require header     [RFC5627]
                            field of a REGISTER request, it indicates that the registrar is not expected to process the registration
                            unless it supports the GRUU extension.
                            When used with the Supported header field, this option tag indicates the UAC supports the History Information
   histinfo                 to be captured for requests and returned in subsequent responses. This tag is not used in a Proxy-Require or  [RFC7044]
                            Require header field, since support of History-Info is optional.
   ice                      This option tag is used to identify the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) extension. When present  [RFC5768]
                            in a Require header field, it indicates that ICE is required by an agent.
   join                     Support for the SIP Join Header                                                                               [RFC3911]
   multiple-refer           This option tag indicates support for REFER requests that contain a resource list document describing         [RFC5368]
                            multiple REFER targets.
   norefersub               This option tag specifies a User Agent ability of accepting a REFER request without establishing an implicit  [RFC4488]
                            subscription (compared to the default case defined in [RFC3515].
   nosub                    This option tag identifies an extension to REFER to suppress the implicit subscription and indicate that no   [RFC7614]
                            explicit subscription is forthcoming.
                            This option-tag is used to identify UAs and Registrars which support extensions for Client Initiated
   outbound                 Connections. A UA places this option in a Supported header to communicate its support for this extension. A   [RFC5626]
                            Registrar places this option-tag in a Require header to indicate to the registering User Agent that the
                            Registrar used registrations using the binding rules defined in this extension.
                            A SIP UA that supports the Path extension header field includes this option tag as a header field value in a
                            Supported header field in all requests generated by that UA. Intermediate proxies may use the presence of
   path                     this option tag in a REGISTER request to determine whether to offer Path service for for that request. If an  [RFC3327]
                            intermediate proxy requires that the registrar support Path for a request, then it includes this option tag
                            as a header field value in a Requires header field in that request.
   policy                   This option tag is used to indicate that a UA can process policy server URIs for and subscribe to             [RFC6794]
                            session-specific policies.
                            An offerer MUST include this tag in the Require header field if the offer contains one or more "mandatory"
   precondition             strength-tags. If all the strength-tags in the description are "optional" or "none" the offerer MUST include  [RFC3312]
                            this tag either in a Supported header field or in a Require header field.
   pref                     This option tag is used to ensure that a server understands the callee capabilities parameters used in the    [RFC3840]
                            request.
                            This option tag indicates support for the Privacy mechanism. When used in the Proxy-Require header, it
   privacy                  indicates that proxy servers do not forward the request unless they can provide the requested privacy         [RFC3323]
                            service. This tag is not used in the Require or Supported headers. Proxies remove this option tag before
                            forwarding the request if the desired privacy function has been performed.
   recipient-list-invite    The body contains a list of URIs that indicates the recipients of the SIP INVITE request                      [RFC5366]
   recipient-list-message   The body contains a list of URIs that indicates the recipients of the SIP MESSAGE request                     [RFC5365]
   recipient-list-subscribe This option tag is used to ensure that a server can process the recipient-list body used in a SUBSCRIBE       [RFC5367]
                            request.
   replaces                 This option tag indicates support for the SIP Replaces header.                                                [RFC3891]
   resource-priority        Indicates or requests support for the resource priority mechanism.                                            [RFC4412]
                            The option-tag sdp-anat is defined for use in the Require and Supported SIP [RFC3261] header fields. SIP user
   sdp-anat                 agents that place this option-tag in a Supported header field understand the ANAT semantics as defined in     [RFC4092]
                            [RFC4091].
                            This option tag indicates support for the Security Agreement mechanism. When used in the Require, or
                            Proxy-Require headers, it indicates that proxy servers are required to use the Security Agreement mechanism.
   sec-agree                When used in the Supported header, it indicates that the User Agent Client supports the Security Agreement    [RFC3329]
                            mechanism. When used in the Require header in the 494 (Security Agreement Required) or 421 (Extension
                            Required) responses, it indicates that the User Agent Client must use the Security Agreement Mechanism.
                            This option tag is used to identify the target dialog header field extension. When used in a Require header
   tdialog                  field, it implies that the recipient needs to support the Target-Dialog header field. When used in a          [RFC4538]
                            Supported header field, it implies that the sender of the message supports it.
                            This option tag is for support of the session timer extension. Inclusion in a Supported header field in a
                            request or response indicates that the UA is capable of performing refreshes according to that specification.
   timer                    Inclusion in a Require header in a request means that the UAS must understand the session timer extension to  [RFC4028]
                            process the request. Inclusion in a Require header field in a response indicates that the UAC must look for
                            the Session-Expires header field in the response, and process accordingly.
   uui                      This option tag is used to indicate that a UA supports and understands the User-to-User header field.         [RFC7433]
