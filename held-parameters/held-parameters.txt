   xmlError            This code indicates that the XML content of the request was either badly formed or invalid.                        [RFC5985]
   generalLisError     This code indicates that an unspecified error occurred at the LIS.                                                 [RFC5985]
   locationUnknown     This code indicates that the LIS could not determine the location of the Device.                                   [RFC5985]
   unsupportedMessage  This code indicates that the request was not supported or understood by the LIS. This error code is used when a    [RFC5985]
                       HELD request contains a document element that is not supported by the receiver.
   timeout             This code indicates that the LIS could not satisfy the request within the time specified in the "responseTime"     [RFC5985]
                       parameter.
   cannotProvideLiType This code indicates that the LIS was unable to provide LI of the type or types requested. This code is used when   [RFC5985]

                       badly formatted, or not one for which the requester was authorized to make a request.
