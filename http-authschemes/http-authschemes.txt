   Basic                      [RFC7617]

                                                       The HOBA scheme can be used with either HTTP servers or proxies. When used in response to a
   HOBA                       [RFC7486, Section 3]     407 Proxy Authentication Required indication, the appropriate proxy authentication header
                                                       fields are used instead, as with any other HTTP authentication scheme.
                                                       This authentication scheme violates both HTTP semantics (being connection-oriented) and
   Negotiate                  [RFC4559, Section 3]     syntax (use of syntax incompatible with the WWW-Authenticate and Authorization header field
                                                       syntax).
