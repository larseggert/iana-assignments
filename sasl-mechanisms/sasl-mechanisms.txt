                                              Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) Mechanisms

   Last Updated

   Note

 The Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) [RFC4422] is a
 method for adding authentication support to connection-based
 protocols.  To use this specification, a protocol includes a command
 for identifying and authenticating a user to a server and for
 optionally negotiating a security layer for subsequent protocol
 interactions.  The command has a required argument identifying a SASL
 mechanism.

 SASL mechanisms are named by strings, from 1 to 20 characters in
 length, consisting of upper-case letters, digits, hyphens, and/or
 underscores.  SASL mechanism names must be registered with the IANA.
 Procedures for registering new SASL mechanisms are described in
 [RFC4422].

 SASL mechanism names starting with "GS2-" are reserved for SASL
 mechanisms which conform to [RFC5801].

 Registration procedures for SASL mechanism names starting with
 "SCRAM-" are defined in [RFC7677].
