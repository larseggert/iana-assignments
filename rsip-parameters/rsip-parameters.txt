   Registration Procedure(s)

 Specification Required

   Expert(s)

 Unassigned

   Reference
           [RFC3103]

   Note

 100s  General errors
 200s  Parameter and message errors.  The gateway uses these errors
       when it detects that a parameter or message is malformed, as
       well as when it does not understand a parameter or message.
 300s  Permission, resource, and policy errors.  The gateway uses these
       errors when a host has attempted to do something that it is
       not permitted to do, or something that violated gateway policy.
 400s  IPsec errors.  All errors specific to RSIP / IPsec operation.
