 Unassigned

   Reference
           [RFC3103]

   Note

 100's  General errors
 200's  Parameter and message errors.  The gateway uses these errors
        when it detects that a parameter or message is malformed, as
        well as when it does not understand a parameter or message.
 300's  Permission, resource, and policy errors.  The gateway uses these
        errors when a host has attempted to do something that it is
        not permitted to do, or something that violated gateway policy.
 400's  IPsec errors.  All errors specific to RSIP / IPsec operation.
