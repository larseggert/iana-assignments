  21   The Selector ID contains an application ID from the Qosmos     4       [Paul_Aitken][Qosmos]

                                           The counters for an Original Flow are added to the counters of the appropriate Aggregated Flow
     1   Start Interval                    containing the start time of the Original Flow. This should be assumed the default if value    [RFC7015]
                                           distribution information is not available at a Collecting Process for an Aggregated Flow.
     2   End Interval                      The counters for an Original Flow are added to the counters of the appropriate Aggregated Flow [RFC7015]
                                           containing the end time of the Original Flow.
     3   Mid Interval                      The counters for an Original Flow are added to the counters of a single appropriate Aggregated [RFC7015]
                                           Flow containing some timestamp between start and end time of the Original Flow.
                                           Each counter for an Original Flow is divided by the number of time intervals the Original Flow
     4   Simple Uniform Distribution       covers (i.e., of appropriate Aggregated Flows sharing the same Flow Key), and this number is   [RFC7015]
                                           added to each corresponding counter in each Aggregated Flow.
                                           Each counter for an Original Flow is divided by the number of time units the Original Flow
                                           covers, to derive a mean count rate. This mean count rate is then multiplied by the number of
     5   Proportional Uniform Distribution time units in the intersection of the duration of the Original Flow and the time interval of   [RFC7015]
                                           each Aggregated Flow. This is like simple uniform distribution, but accounts for the
                                           fractional portions of a time interval covered by an Original Flow in the first and last time
                                           interval.
                                           Each counter of the Original Flow is distributed among the intervals of the Aggregated Flows
                                           according to some function the Intermediate Aggregation Process uses based upon properties of
     6   Simulated Process                 Flows presumed to be like the Original Flow. This is essentially an assertion that the         [RFC7015]
                                           Intermediate Aggregation Process has no direct packet timing information but is nevertheless
                                           not using one of the other simpler distribution methods. The Intermediate Aggregation Process
                                           specifically makes no assertion as to the correctness of the simulation.
     7   Direct                            The Intermediate Aggregation Process has access to the original packet timings from the        [RFC7015]
                                           packets making up the Original Flow, and uses these to distribute or recalculate the counters.

     0x00    noneOf       The "noneOf" structured data type semantic specifies that none of the elements are actual properties of the     [RFC6313]
                          Data Record.
     0x01    exactlyOneOf The "exactlyOneOf" structured data type semantic specifies that only a single element from the structured data  [RFC6313]
                          is an actual property of the Data Record. This is equivalent to a logical XOR operation.
     0x02    oneOrMoreOf  The "oneOrMoreOf" structured data type semantic specifies that one or more elements from the list in the        [RFC6313]
                          structured data are actual properties of the Data Record. This is equivalent to a logical OR operation.

                          actual properties of the Data Record.
     0x04    ordered      The "ordered" structured data type semantic specifies that elements from the list in the structured data are    [RFC6313]
                          ordered.

                          The "undefined" structured data type semantic specifies that the semantic of the list elements is not specified
     0xFF    undefined    and that, if a semantic exists, then it is up to the Collecting Process to draw its own conclusions. The        [RFC6313]
                          "undefined" structured data type semantic is the default structured data type semantic.
