 is broken into three regions.  2-254 will be allocated to individual
 QoS control services.

Compression Hints

   Registration Procedure(s)

 IETF Review

   Reference
           [RFC3006]

   Note

 Hints are represented by a 32 bit field, with the high order 16 bits
 being the IP-compression-protocol number as defined in [RFC1332] and
 [RFC3544].  The low order 16 bits are a sub-option for the cases
 where the IP-compression-protocol number alone is not sufficient for
 int-serv purposes.
