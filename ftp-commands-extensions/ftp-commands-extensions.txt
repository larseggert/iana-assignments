   Reference
           [RFC5797]

   Note

     Note: An IESG Standards Action is allowed to direct IANA to change the
     Conformance Requirements listed for any entry.

     The following commands are part of the base FTP specification
     [RFC0959] and are listed in the registry with the immutable pseudo
     FEAT code "base".

     Mandatory commands:

     ABOR, ACCT, ALLO, APPE, CWD, DELE, HELP, LIST, MODE, NLST, NOOP,
     PASS, PASV, PORT, QUIT, REIN, REST, RETR, RNFR, RNTO, SITE, STAT,
     STOR, STRU, TYPE, USER

     Optional commands:

     CDUP, MKD, PWD, RMD, SMNT, STOU, SYST

     Note: STD 3 [RFC1123] clarified and updated the status and
     implementation requirements of these standard FTP commands, and it
     contains important complementary information for the following
     commands:

     LIST, NLST, PASV, REST, SITE, STOU

     The following commands were specified as experimental in an extension
     to an early version of the FTP specification [RFC0775] but later
     deprecated by RFC 1123 [RFC1123], because Standard FTP [RFC0959]
     specifies their standard successors.  They are listed in the registry
     with the immutable pseudo FEAT code "hist".

     XCUP, XCWD, XMKD, XPWD, XRMD

     Implementation note:  Deployed FTP clients still make use of the
     deprecated commands and most FTP servers support them as aliases
     for the standard commands.

     The following commands were specified as part of the "FOOBAR" IPng
     effort in RFC 1545 [RFC1545] and, later, RFC 1639 [RFC1639] and are
     now obsolete.  They are listed in the registry with the immutable
     pseudo FEAT code "hist".

     LPRT, LPSV

     Legend for the registry:

         o  cmd (Command Name)

             Amended versions of commands are tagged with a trailing "+"

         o  FEAT Code

             Keyword returned in FEAT response line for this command/extension:

              - actual FEAT codes are given in upper case
              - placeholders (pseudo FEAT codes) are shown in lower case
              - "-N/A-" indicates a feature not related to one particular command

             See the "Extension name" clause in Section 2.2 of
             [RFC5797] for details.

         o  description

             Brief description of command / extension

         o  type (Command Type)

             Type or "kind" of command, based on Section 4.1 of [RFC959]:

              'a'  ... access control
              'p'  ... parameter setting
              's'  ... service execution

             Combinations like 'p/s' are possible.

         o  conf (Conformance Requirements)

             Expectation for support in modern FTP implementations:

              'm'  ... mandatory to implement
              'o'  ... optional
              'h'  ... historic

   [1] While an IETF Standards Action would be required to make the FEAT
       mechanism [RFC2389] mandatory, implementation of that extension
       mechanism is clearly required in conjunction with any extension or
       feature that depends on it.
