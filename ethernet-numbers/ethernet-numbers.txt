   Note

 This page has assignments by IANA as specified in [RFC7042]
 to be under the IANA OUI. For some information on IEEE 802 number
 assignments by the IEEE Registration Authority and how to contact
 that authority, see the [IANA registry ieee-802-numbers].

   Note

 IANA allocates addresses under the IANA OUI (00-00-5E) as explained in
 [RFC7042]. Unicast addresses under the IANA OUI start
 with 00-00-5E, while multicast addresses under the IANA OUI start with
 01-00-5E. In the lists below, these initial 3 bytes are omitted for
 brevity. As described in [RFC7042], 48-bit MAC addresses
 in the range 33-33-00-00-00-00 to 33-33-FF-FF-FF-FF are used for IPv6 multicast.

 When the available space for either multicast or unicast EUI-48
 identifiers under OUI 00-00-5E has been 90% or more exhausted, IANA
 should request an additional OUI from the IEEE Registration Authority
 for further IANA assignment use. The appointed Expert(s) should
 monitor for this condition and notify IANA.


  IANA Unicast 48-bit MAC Addresses

   Note

 These values are prefixed with 00-00-5E.

The CFxxxx Series

   Note

 [RFC2153] described a method of using a "pseudo OUI" for
 certain purposes when there is no appropriate regular OUI assigned.
 The registry for these is on the PPP Parameters IANA web page.
 The CF series registry has been closed by [RFC5342].
 Please see: [IANA registry ppp-numbers].

 The SNAP protocol number assignments use the IANA OUI. Values 0000 and FFFF require
