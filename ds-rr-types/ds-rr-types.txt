   Expert(s)

 Mark Andrews, Roy Arends, Warren Kumari, Wes Hardaker

   Reference
   [RFC3658][RFC4034][RFC4035][RFC9157][RFC9904]

   Note

 Adding a new entry to the "Digest Algorithms" registry with a
 recommended value of "MAY" in the "Use for DNSSEC Delegation”,
 "Use for DNSSEC Validation", "Implement for DNSSEC Delegation", or
 "Implement for DNSSEC Validation" columns SHALL follow the
 Specification Required policy as defined in [RFC8126].

 Adding a new entry to, or changing an existing value in, the
 "Digest Algorithms" registry that has any value other than “MAY"
 in the "Use for DNSSEC Delegation", "Use for DNSSEC Validation”,
 "Implement for DNSSEC Delegation", or "Implement for DNSSEC
 Validation" columns requires Standards Action.

 If an item is not marked as "RECOMMENDED", it does not
 necessarily mean that it is flawed; rather, it indicates
 that the item either has not been through the IETF consensus
 process, has limited applicability, or is intended only for
 specific use cases.
