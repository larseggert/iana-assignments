   Note

 Adding a new entry to the "Digest Algorithms" registry with a
 recommended value of "MAY" in the "Use for DNSSEC Delegation",
 "Use for DNSSEC Validation", "Implement for DNSSEC Delegation",
 or "Implement for DNSSEC Validation" columns SHALL follow the
 "Specification Required" policy as defined in [RFC8126].

 Adding a new entry to, or changing existing values in, the
 "Digest Algorithms" registry for the "Use for DNSSEC Delegation",
 "Use for DNSSEC Validation", "Implement for DNSSEC Delegation",
 or "Implement for DNSSEC Validation" columns to any other value
 than "MAY" requires a Standards Action.

 If an item is not marked as "RECOMMENDED", it does not
 necessarily mean that it is flawed; rather, it indicates
 that the item either has not been through the IETF consensus
 process, has limited applicability, or is intended only for
 specific use cases.
