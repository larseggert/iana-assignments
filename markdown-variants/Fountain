Description:
Fountain is a simple markup syntax for writing, editing, and sharing
screenplays in plain, human-readable text. Fountain allows you to
work on your screenplay anywhere, on any computer or tablet, using
any software that edits text files.

Fragment Identifiers:
See <http://fountain.io/syntax#section-titlepage> and
<http://fountain.io/syntax#section-sections>. In the following
fragment identifiers, the <key> and <sec*> productions MUST have "/"
characters percent-encoded.

#/       Title Page (acts as metadata).
#/<key>  Title Page; <key> is the key string.
#<sec1> *("/" <secn>)
         Section or subsection. The <sec1>..<secn>
         productions are the text of the Section line,
         with whitespace trimmed from both ends.
         Subsections (sections with multiple # characters at
         at the beginning of the line in the source)
         are addressed hierarchically by preceding
         the subsection with higher-order
         sections. If the section hierarchy "skips",
         e.g., # to ###, use a blank section name,
         e.g., #Section/ACT%20I//PATIO%20SCENE.
