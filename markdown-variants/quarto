Name: Quarto

Description:
Quarto is a markdown system for scientific and technical publishing.
Quarto is based on Pandoc so includes both the core capabilities
and syntax of Pandoc along with extensions for executable code blocks,
diagrams, cross-references, author/affiliation metadata, figure
panels, and content shortcodes.

Fragment Identifiers:
Quarto defines fragment identifiers using the <id> in the
{#<id> .class ...} production (PHP Markdown Extra attribute block).
This syntax works for Header Identifiers and Code Block Identifiers.
