Description:
MyST Markdown (https://myst-tools.org) is used in software documentation (primarily Python) and in scientific writing, the Markup is stewarded and standardized by https://executablebooks.org. The MyST Markdown community has been asked as part of a format discussion in Jupyter (computational notebooks for data science & researchers) to better define the Markdown variant that we curate as that will be required in a future version of Jupyter.
