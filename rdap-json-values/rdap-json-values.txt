                                 The object instance is associated with other object instances in the registry. This
   associated        status      is most commonly used to signify that a nameserver is associated with a domain or   [IESG]               [RFC9083]

                                 The object instance is in use. For domain names, it signifies that the domain name
   active            status      is published in DNS. For network and autnum registrations, it signifies that they   [IESG]               [RFC9083]
                                 are allocated or assigned for use in operational networks. This maps to the "OK"

                                 A request has been received for the deletion or removal of the object instance, but
   pending delete    status      this action is not yet complete. For domains, this might mean that the name is no   [IESG]               [RFC9083]

                                 This grace period is provided after the initial registration of the object. If the
                                 object is deleted by the client during this period, the server provides a credit to

                                 This grace period is provided after an object registration period expires and is
                                 extended (renewed) automatically by the server. If the object is deleted by the
   auto renew period status      client during this period, the server provides a credit to the client for the cost  [IESG]               [RFC8056]
                                 of the auto renewal. This maps to the Domain Registry Grace Period Mapping for the

                                 The client requested that requests to delete the object MUST be rejected. This maps

                                 The client requested that requests to update the object (other than to remove this

                                 An object is in the process of being restored after being in the redemption period

                                 A delete has been received, but the object has not yet been purged because an
   redemption period status      opportunity exists to restore the object and abort the deletion process. This maps  [IESG]               [RFC8056]

                                 This grace period is provided after an object registration period is explicitly

   renew period      status      this period, the server provides a credit to the client for the cost of the         [IESG]               [RFC8056]

                                 This grace period is provided after the successful transfer of object registration
