   UserId         category       0    current-user      The current user id being used by the user or process. On Unix systems, this      [RFC4765]

                                                        The actual identity of the user or process being reported on. On those systems

                                                        The user id the user or process is attempting to become. This would apply, on
   UserId         category       2    target-user       Unix systems for example, when the user attempts to use "su," "rlogin," "telnet," [RFC4765]

                                                        systems, this would be the "real" group id, in general.
                                                        Another group id the group or process has the ability to use, or a group id
                                                        associated with a file permission. On Unix systems, this would be the "effective"

                                                        be used to include all the group ids on the "group list."
