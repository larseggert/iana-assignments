          Result Type                                                        Description                                                  Reference
   starttls-not-supported    This indicates that the recipient MX did not support STARTTLS.                                               [RFC8460]
                             This indicates that the certificate presented did not adhere to the constraints specified in the MTA-STS or
   certificate-host-mismatch DANE policy, e.g., if the MX hostname does not match any identities listed in the subject alternative name   [RFC8460]
                             (SAN) [RFC5280].
   certificate-expired       This indicates that the certificate has expired.                                                             [RFC8460]
   tlsa-invalid              This indicates a validation error in the TLSA record associated with a DANE policy. None of the records in   [RFC8460]
                             the RRset were found to be valid.
   dnssec-invalid            This indicates that no valid records were returned from the recursive resolver.                              [RFC8460]
                             This indicates that the sending system is configured to require DANE TLSA records for all the MX hosts of
   dane-required             the destination domain, but no DNSSEC-validated TLSA records were present for the MX host that is the        [RFC8460]
                             subject of the report. Mandatory DANE for SMTP is described in Section 6 of [RFC7672]. Such policies may be
                             created by mutual agreement between two organizations that frequently exchange sensitive content via email.
                             This is a label that covers multiple certificate-related failures that include, but are not limited to,
   certificate-not-trusted   errors such as untrusted/unknown certification authorities (CAs), certificate name constraints, certificate  [RFC8460]
                             chain errors, etc. When using this declaration, the reporting MTA SHOULD utilize the "failure-reason-code"
                             to provide more information to the receiving entity.
   sts-policy-invalid        This indicates a validation error for the overall MTA-STS Policy.                                            [RFC8460]
   sts-webpki-invalid        This indicates that the MTA-STS Policy could not be authenticated using PKIX validation.                     [RFC8460]
                             This indicates a general failure for a reason not matching a category above. When using this declaration,
   validation-failure        the reporting MTA SHOULD utilize the "failure-reason-code" to provide more information to the receiving      [RFC8460]
                             entity.
   sts-policy-fetch-error    This indicates a failure to retrieve an MTA-STS policy, for example, because the policy host is unreachable. [RFC8460]
