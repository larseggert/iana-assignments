   0x09      RPF_IF         Mtrace2 Request arrived on the expected RPF interface for this source and group.                              [RFC8487]
   0x0A      NO_MULTICAST   Mtrace2 Request arrived on an interface which is not enabled for multicast.                                   [RFC8487]
   0x0B      INFO_HIDDEN    One or more hops have been hidden from this trace.                                                            [RFC8487]
   0x0C      REACHED_GW     Mtrace2 Request arrived on a gateway (e.g., a NAT or firewall) that hides the information between this router [RFC8487]
