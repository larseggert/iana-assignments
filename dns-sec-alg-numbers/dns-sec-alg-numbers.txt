DNS Security Algorithm Numbers

   Registration Procedure(s)

 Standards Action or Specification Required

   Expert(s)

 Unassigned

   Reference
   [RFC4034][RFC3755][RFC6014][RFC6944][RFC-ietf-dnsop-rfc8624-bis-13]

   Note

 Adding a new entry to the "DNS Security Algorithm Numbers”
 registry with a recommended value of "MAY" in the "Use for DNSSEC
 Signing", "Use for DNSSEC Validation", "Implement for DNSSEC
 Signing", or "Implement for DNSSEC Validation" columns will be
 subject to the Specification Required policy as defined in
 [RFC8126] in order to promote continued evolution of DNSSEC
 algorithms and DNSSEC agility. New entries added through the
 Specification Required process will have the value of "MAY” for
 all columns.

 Adding a new entry to, or changing an existing value in, the “DNS
 Security Algorithm Numbers" registry that has any value other than
 "MAY" in the "Use for DNSSEC Signing", "Use for DNSSEC
 Validation", "Implement for DNSSEC Signing", or "Implement for
 DNSSEC Validation" columns requires Standards Action.

 If an item is not marked as "RECOMMENDED", it does not necessarily mean
 that it is flawed; rather, it indicates that the item either has not been
 through the IETF consensus process, has limited applicability, or is
 intended only for specific use cases.


   Note

 The KEY, SIG, DNSKEY, RRSIG, DS, and CERT RRs use an 8-bit number used
 to identify the security algorithm being used.

 All algorithm numbers in this registry may be used in CERT RRs. Zone
 signing (DNSSEC) and transaction security mechanisms (SIG(0) and TSIG)
 make use of particular subsets of these algorithms. Only algorithms
 usable for zone signing may appear in DNSKEY, RRSIG, and DS RRs.
 Only those usable for SIG(0) and TSIG may appear in SIG and KEY RRs.

 * There has been no determination of standardization of the use of this
 algorithm with Transaction Security.
