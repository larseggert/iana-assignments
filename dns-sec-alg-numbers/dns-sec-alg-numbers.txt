DNS Security Algorithm Numbers

   Registration Procedure(s)

 RFC Required

   Reference
   [RFC4034][RFC3755][RFC6014][RFC6944]

   Note

 The KEY, SIG, DNSKEY, RRSIG, DS, and CERT RRs use an 8-bit number used
 to identify the security algorithm being used.

 All algorithm numbers in this registry may be used in CERT RRs. Zone
 signing (DNSSEC) and transaction security mechanisms (SIG(0) and TSIG)
 make use of particular subsets of these algorithms. Only algorithms
 usable for zone signing may appear in DNSKEY, RRSIG, and DS RRs.
 Only those usable for SIG(0) and TSIG may appear in SIG and KEY RRs.

 * There has been no determination of standardization of the use of this
 algorithm with Transaction Security.
