   Description

 This MIB module defines the IANACharset
 TEXTUAL-CONVENTION.  The IANACharset TC is used to
 specify the encoding of string objects defined in
 a MIB.

 Each version of this MIB will be released based on
 the IANA Charset Registry file (see RFC 2978) at
 http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets.

 Note:  The IANACharset TC, originally defined in
 RFC 1759, was inaccurately named CodedCharSet.

 Note:  Best practice is to define new MIB string
 objects with invariant UTF-8 (RFC 3629) syntax
 using the SnmpAdminString TC (defined in RFC 3411)
 in accordance with IETF Policy on Character Sets and
 Languages (RFC 2277).

 Copyright (C) The Internet Society (2004).  The
 initial version of this MIB module was published
 in RFC 3808; for full legal notices see the RFC
 itself.  Supplementary information may be
 available on
 http://www.ietf.org/copyrights/ianamib.html.
