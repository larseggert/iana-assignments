   Registration Procedure(s)

 IANA does not assign

   Reference
           [Not IETF]

   Note

 Below is the current list of PRONET 80 Type Numbers.  A protocol
 that is on this list does not necessarily mean that there is any
 implementation of it on ProNET.

 Of these, protocols 1, 14, and 20 are the only ones that have ever
 been seen in ARP packets.

 For reference, the header is (one byte/line):

         destination hardware address
         source hardware address
         data link header version (2)
         data link header protocol number
         data link header reserved (0)
         data link header reserved (0)

 Some protocols have been known to tuck stuff in the reserved fields.

 Those who need a protocol number on ProNET-10/80 should contact
 Avri Doria <avri&proteon.com>.
